# SidneyKim0 Analysis Methodology

## Overview

Macro-statistical analysis methodology combining top-down macro regime identification with quantitative pattern detection and probabilistic scenario analysis. Explicitly NOT narrative-driven, NOT sentiment-following, NOT bottom-up fundamental analysis. Statistical data and macro regime context drive conclusions, not stories.

## Core Philosophy

### Data Over Narrative

Every thesis must be backed by specific quantitative data. When market consensus is narrative-driven and data diverges, the data wins eventually. The analyst's job is to find the divergence early.

Key distinction: narrative changes fast; macro structure changes slowly. Short-term price action follows narratives, but macro structure determines the final resolution.

### Macro Regime First

Individual asset analysis without macro regime context is incomplete. The market cycle phase determines which signals are reliable, which assets benefit, and which risk factors dominate. Determine the regime before analyzing individual positions.

### Statistical Edge Over Conviction

Probability-based positioning over high-conviction bets. State the probability, the historical base rate, and the scenario count — not just the direction. "통계 10번 중 8번" (8 out of 10 historically) is more useful than "I'm confident it will fall."

### "Law of Large Numbers" Trading Rule

"일어나야 할 일은 결국 일어난다" — if the statistical expectation says an event should occur, maintain the position until (a) it occurs or (b) the underlying condition changes. Do not abandon a statistically well-founded position due to short-term noise. Duration is governed by the statistical condition persisting, not by elapsed time.

## Market Regime Classification

Four primary market regimes, each with distinct asset behavior and analysis priorities. Regimes are not always clean — sub-regimes and transition states exist.

### 1. Earnings Cycle / Financial Cycle

**Definition**: Fundamentals drive asset prices. Rates are neutral or declining. Economic growth is translating directly into earnings growth.

**Sub-regime — "Good is Good"**: Strong economic data → stock rally. The market rewards fundamentals directly. Rate headwinds are not dominant. Key tell: if equities underperform despite solid earnings while crypto, silver, and HY are rising, the regime is fracturing — not clearly "good is good" anymore.

**Sub-regime — "Bad is Good"**: Weak data triggers rate-cut expectations that lift equities. This is a *financial cycle* sub-regime where monetary policy expectations, not earnings, drive prices. Distinguish from earnings-driven "good is good" by checking whether risk assets are rallying on economic weakness (bad data → rate cut hope → rally).

**Signals**:
- "Good is good" feedback loop: strong economic data → stock rally
- High-yield and growth stocks outperform
- Correlations between risk assets are high and positive
- Market breadth expanding

**Analysis priority**: Earnings acceleration, sector rotation, forward P/E relative to growth

**US analog**: 2017, 2023 H2, 2024 H1

### 2. Reverse Financial Cycle

**Definition**: Inflation prevents monetary easing despite economic weakness. Rates stay "higher for longer" even as growth decelerates. The market's multiple compression exceeds earnings growth.

**Sub-regime — "Bad is Bad, Broken"**: Rate cuts are priced in but the market *doesn't rally on them*. This is the degraded state of the reverse financial cycle — the market has lost faith that rate cuts will fix the underlying problem. When "bad is good" breaks and becomes "bad is just bad," the regime has fully shifted to reverse financial.

**Signals**:
- "Bad is bad" — weak data triggers both equity and bond selling
- Safe-haven assets (gold, USD) rally simultaneously with high-yield weakness
- CAPE/ERP divergence: CAPE elevated while ERP compresses to near zero
- FedWatch pricing fewer cuts than consensus expected
- High-yield bonds underperform investment grade

**Analysis priority**: US10Y trajectory, FedWatch probability shifts, ERP level, CAPE multiple sustainability

**US analog**: 2018 Q4, 2022, 2025 H1

---

### 3. Reverse Earnings Cycle

**Definition**: Both rates AND earnings disappoint simultaneously. The market faces double compression — multiple contraction plus earnings revision downward.

**Signals**:
- Earnings guidance cuts across sectors
- Credit spreads widening sharply
- Volume/breadth deterioration
- Leadership breakdown in former cycle leaders
- TGA/RRP liquidity indicators deteriorating

**Analysis priority**: Credit spread trajectory, earnings revision trends, liquidity metrics

**US analog**: 2007-2008, 2022 H2

---

### 4. Liquidity Flow / Wool-Shearing Cycle

**Definition**: Global liquidity flows unilaterally into the US dollar system. EM assets correct first and harder. Yield spread differentials between US and other markets drive FX, which drives capital flows.

**Signals**:
- EM dramatically underperforming DM (after a period of EM outperformance)
- Dollar strengthening while US rates stable or rising
- Gold/commodity softness except gold which retains safe-haven premium
- US10Y-2Y spread widening while EM rates diverge from US
- "약한 고리부터 깨진다" — weaker link assets (HY bonds, EM equities, speculative commodities) crack first

**Historical pattern**: EM outperforms → peak in relative EM strength → DXY pivot → EM corrects → US absorbs global liquidity → EM enters multi-year underperformance

**Wool-shearing mechanism**: When US yield > EM yield, capital flows to US for both safety AND return. When US yield < EM yield, carry trade into EM is temporary. In both scenarios, capital ultimately gravitates toward the US. The divergence phase (EM outperforms despite US yield advantage) resolves violently toward the historical norm.

**US analog**: 1997-1998 (Asia crisis), 2011 H2, 2022

### Barbell Regime (Structural Instability Signal)

**Definition**: Both the safest assets (gold, long-duration Treasuries) and the riskiest assets (HY stocks, crypto) surge simultaneously while intermediate-risk assets (IG bonds, quality equities) lag. Described as "바벨 with 20kg plates on a wooden chopstick" — structurally unstable.

**Common factor**: Rising neutral rate (r*) in all historical instances.

**Historical instances**: 2024 Feb-May, 2007 Aug-Sep, 2025 Jul-Sep

**Interpretation**: This is a regime transition signal, not a stable state. The barbell always resolves — either the safe-haven side wins (risk-off follows) or the risk side wins (risk-on follows). Track which side breaks first.

---

### HOPE Cycle — Macro Transmission Sequence

The macro transmission mechanism follows a specific sequence:
1. **Commodity prices** (leading) — raw materials respond first to demand shifts
2. **PPI** — producer costs reflect commodity price changes with a lag
3. **CPI** — consumer prices follow PPI with further lag
4. **Rate policy** — Fed responds to CPI trajectory
5. **Asset prices** — equities/bonds reprice based on rate expectations

When analyzing "what more needs to happen for rates to fall?" ("뭘 더해야 금리가 빠질 수 있는가?"), trace this sequence from the beginning. If commodity prices haven't fallen, it's premature to expect CPI to drop, which means rate cuts are premature regardless of narrative.

---

### Regime Transition Detection Rules

Regime transitions are identified through a systematic diagnostic:

1. **Check which regime's signals are active**: Count signals from each regime type. Majority wins, but mixed signals = "회색지대" (grey zone).
2. **Track the weak links**: HY bonds, EM equities, and speculative commodities crack first. If they weaken while leading assets hold, transition is underway.
3. **Monitor cross-asset anomalies**: Assets not behaving as the current regime would predict are the highest-alpha signals for regime transition.
4. **Regime flip moment**: "장기금리 상승 & 원화 하락을 시장 호재로 인식하다 악재로 바뀐 것" — when the same data point flips from being interpreted as good news to bad news, the regime has changed.

## Data Cascade Hierarchy

Analyze in this exact order. Higher-order signals constrain lower-order ones.

### Level 1: Rate Regime (Interest Rate Architecture)
- US10Y level and direction (absolute anchor for all valuation)
- Yield curve shape: bear steepening / bull steepening / bear flattening / inverted
- FedWatch cut probability and timeline (CME futures-based)
- ERP = Earnings Yield (1/CAPE) minus US10Y: the equity valuation danger signal
- Neutral rate (r*) structural assessment: if r* is rising, the entire rate complex shifts higher and traditional "high rate" thresholds need adjustment

**Key thresholds**:
- US10Y 4.0-4.5%: High-hurdle zone; requires 9%+ earnings growth to justify current multiples
- US10Y 4.3%: Intermediate decision level — below = rates easing thesis intact; above = higher-for-longer
- US10Y 5%+: Historical rejection zone for equity multiples
- ERP near zero or negative: Historically precedes multiple compression

### Level 2: Dollar and FX Architecture
- DXY direction (USD strengthening = EM headwind)
- Yield spread: US10Y vs. key 10Y (Japan, EUR, EM)
- Spread direction and rate of change

**Key interpretation**:
- When US rates are HIGHER than peer: dollar strengthens, EM equity underperforms
- When US rates are LOWER than peer: dollar weakens, EM may outperform temporarily
- Both conditions ultimately resolve with liquidity flowing to the US (양털깎기 dynamic)
- DXY at 99-100 level: EM trigger threshold and safe-haven easing confirmation level

### Level 3: Cross-Asset Sentiment Architecture
- Gold price direction (safe-haven or risk-asset behavior)
- Gold/Silver ratio: sharp surge = deleveraging, risk-off leading indicator
- Gold-Dollar relationship: Both rising simultaneously = anomaly signal, potential regime shift
- Put/Call ratio on US equities: below 0.6 = extreme bullishness (watch for reversal)
- VIX term structure: contango vs. backwardation
- CAPE ratio: current vs. historical average

**Key thresholds**:
- Put/Call ratio < 0.6: Historically unsustainable bullish sentiment
- CAPE > 35: "Rejection zone" — equity multiple expansion unlikely
- Gold rising while dollar also rising: Safe-haven stress signal, not equity positive

### Level 4: Real Economy and Liquidity Pulse
- BDI (Baltic Dry Index): Real-time global trade volume
- Commodity price indices: GSCI, LME index, CRB index
- Semiconductor spot prices (DRAM, NAND): Forward demand signal
- TGA + RRP → Fed Net Liquidity: Systemic liquidity tracker
- Credit spreads (high-yield vs. investment-grade)
- Leading vs. lagging economic indicator spread (선행-동행 스프레드): When leading indicators are falling but lagging indicators are still holding, the gap signals incoming deterioration that lagging data hasn't yet confirmed

### Level 5: Individual Asset/Sector Context
Only after Levels 1-4 are assessed. Individual asset analysis is constrained by macro regime.

## Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Macro Regime Identification
Determine which of the 4 regimes currently applies. This is not always clean — markets can be transitioning between regimes. When in transition, state the probability of each regime. Check for barbell configuration as a transition signal.

### Step 2: Rate Architecture Assessment
- Current US10Y level and trajectory (up/flat/down)
- Yield curve shape and dynamics
- FedWatch: current vs. consensus expectation divergence (FOMC dot plot vs. CME pricing)
- ERP calculation and historical context

### Step 3: Cross-Asset Signal Mapping
- Map signals from Level 3 instruments
- Flag anomalies: assets that are NOT behaving as the regime would predict
- Anomalies are the highest-alpha signals — they indicate regime transition or mispricing

### Step 4: Historical Analog Selection
- Use pattern similarity to find the top 3-5 historical periods matching:
  (a) current price pattern (N-day window)
  (b) macro regime characteristics
  (c) quantitative indicators (CAPE, ERP, spread levels)
- Weight analogs by match quality (correlation score)

### Step 5: Probabilistic Scenario Construction
- Build 2-3 scenarios based on historical analog base rates
- Assign probabilities from historical outcome distribution
- State invalidation conditions: what would falsify each scenario

### Step 6: Statistical Signal Assessment
- Run relevant quantitative models (see `quantitative_models.md`)
- Cross-validate with historical analog fan chart projections
- Identify any σ-level extremes that historically precede mean reversion

### Step 7: Positioning
- State current regime conviction
- Translate scenario probabilities to risk/reward
- State what changes would shift conviction (duration management)

## Consensus vs. Data Divergence Principle

When sell-side consensus and statistical data diverge, the data wins eventually. Key diagnostic questions:

1. **Is the narrative already priced in?** If an asset has moved significantly on a narrative, and data doesn't confirm it, the narrative is borrowed from the future.
2. **Are "weak links" holding up?** High-yield bonds, EM equities, and speculative commodities are the canaries. If they weaken while leading assets still hold, regime transition is underway.
3. **What does the distribution say?** Instead of debating direction, compute the historical probability distribution. "RSI 80에 도달한 이후 1달 내 되돌림 확률 80%" is more actionable than "I think it will fall."
4. **Hawkish extreme statements as contrarian signals**: When prominent figures make extreme hawkish calls (e.g., Dimon "US10Y could hit 8%"), historically this has coincided with rate peaks, not further rate increases. Track these as contrarian indicators.

## Risk Management and Duration Philosophy

- Position duration is macro-regime dependent: in 실적장세, hold longer; in 역금융장세, reduce duration
- σ-level extremes (±3σ, ±4σ) trigger position review, not automatic action — context determines response
- "4시그마의 벽이 무너지면 예상 밖의 이동" — when 4σ walls break, regime reassessment mandatory
- When positioned against consensus, track the RSI/σ level and define the exit criteria before entering
- **3σ entry rule for short positions**: Enter short at 3σ extension, but only with position size appropriate to the σ-level risk. Leverage should decrease as extension increases (paradoxically, more extreme = more cautious sizing because the 4σ tail risk is undefined)
- **Conviction vs. Confirmation allocation**: Allocate 30% at conviction point (macro thesis formed), scale to 70% at confirmation point (data validates thesis), hold remaining 30% for position management

> "이미 통계를 근거로 포지션을 유지할 계획입니다" — The position duration is governed by statistics, not by conviction alone

## US Fiscal Sustainability Framework

A structural overlay for all macro analysis:

- **GDP growth rate vs. interest rate**: When government borrowing cost (weighted average coupon) exceeds nominal GDP growth rate, debt-to-GDP ratio mechanically increases regardless of fiscal policy. This is the structural ceiling for all "soft landing" narratives.
- **Treasury issuance composition**: Monitor the ratio of T-bill vs. coupon-bearing issuance. Heavy T-bill issuance drains short-term liquidity (TGA dynamics), while heavy coupon issuance raises long-term rates (bear steepening).
- **Political cycle overlay**: Pre-election periods have a fiscal floor (government spending increases). Post-election periods have fiscal uncertainty. This is a structural macro calendar effect to weight into scenario probabilities.
