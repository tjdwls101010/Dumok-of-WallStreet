# Williams Market Analysis: Intermarket & Macro Framework

## Overview

Williams' intermarket analysis is founded on a principle from Logic 101: you cannot predict A with A. Using price to predict price -- through oscillators, moving averages, or trend lines -- is fundamentally circular. The solution is to use data from a DIFFERENT market (Market A) to predict the market you want to trade (Market B). Bonds predicting stocks is the strongest such relationship Williams has found, producing $141,792 in S&P profits without EVER using S&P price data for entry signals. This chapter covers the Bond-Stock relationship, Gold-Bond dynamics, COT analysis, and the price behavior truths that form Williams' macro analysis framework.

## Bond-Stock Leading Indicator

### The Core Discovery

Bond price movements lead stock price movements. When bonds break to new highs, stock prices follow. This is not a chart pattern observation -- it is a fundamental economic relationship driven by interest rates and capital flows.

### 14-Day Channel Breakout System

**Signal**: Buy the S&P 500 (market on close) any day that the Bond market closes higher than the highest high of the past 14 trading days.

**Exit Options**:
- Option A: Trailing stop at the lowest low of the past 17 days IN BONDS (not in the S&P), OR a $3,000 dollar stop from entry
- Option B: Exit at the lowest low of the past 12 days in the S&P (using S&P price only for exit protection)
- Option C: 1-2 day hold with bailout exit

### Quantitative Results (1982-1998)

**Option A (Bond-based exit)**:
- Net profit: $141,792
- Total trades: 81
- Accuracy: 53%
- Average winning trade: $5,510 (2.20x the average loss of $2,504)
- Drawdown: $18,722
- Profit factor: 2.49

**Option B (S&P-based exit)**:
- Net profit: $123,355
- Total trades: 106
- Accuracy: 45%
- Average winning trade: $4,288 (3.01x the average loss of $1,422)
- Profit factor: 2.49

**Option C (Short-term bailout)**:
- Net profit: $88,055
- Total trades: 480
- Accuracy: 82%
- Average profit per trade: $183
- Profit factor: 1.97

### Critical Insight

Channel breakouts in the S&P itself produce miserable results as a trading system. Channel breakouts in BONDS produce excellent S&P results across virtually any channel length tested. This proves that bonds drive stocks, not the other way around, and validates the principle that the best predictions come from outside the market being traded.

## Gold-Bond Relationship

### Signal Rule

When Gold closes LOWER than its price 20-24 days ago, it creates a favorable condition for Bond buying. Gold weakness signals deflationary pressures or reduced inflation expectations, which is bullish for fixed-income instruments.

### Application in GSV System

In the Greatest Swing Value system for Bonds:
- **Buy setup**: Close lower than 5 days ago (oversold) + TDW is Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday + Bond entry using 180% of 4-day buy swing value
- **Sell setup**: Close higher than 6 days ago (overbought) + Gold price lower than 20 days ago (favorable macro condition for bond shorts reversal)
- Results (1990-1998): $52,812 profit, 75% accuracy, 161 trades, profit factor 2.01

For S&P GSV trading, requiring Bonds to close higher than 15 days ago for buys (and lower for sells) dramatically improved results: $105,675 profit, 67% accuracy, 247 trades.

## Inter-Market Filter Rules

Williams uses specific lookback periods to compare market levels as filters:

### Bond Filters for Stock Trading

| Lookback | Application | Condition |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| 5 days | Short-term oversold setup | Bond close < close 5 days ago |
| 14 days | Channel breakout signal | Bond close > highest high of 14 days |
| 15 days | Trend confirmation | Bond close > close 15 days ago for S&P buy |
| 17 days | Trailing exit | Bond close < lowest low of 17 days triggers S&P exit |
| 35 days | Long-term trend | Used for extended position holding decisions |

### Gold Filters for Bond Trading

| Lookback | Application | Condition |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| 20 days | GSV sell setup | Gold close < close 20 days ago favors Bond selling |
| 24 days | Extended macro filter | Gold below 24-day level signals deflationary impulse |

### Cross-Market Application Principle

The best intermarket filters use a DIFFERENT market for entry signals and either the same market or a third market for exit. This avoids the logical trap of using price to predict price while maintaining practical risk management through dollar stops.

## COT Analysis (Commitment of Traders)

### The Three Groups

The CFTC publishes the Commitment of Traders report weekly, showing positions of three groups:

1. **Small Speculators**: Retail traders like most readers. By and large, this group is selling at market lows and buying at market highs. They tend to do the wrong thing most of the time. Coppering their wagers (trading opposite to them) is profitable.

2. **Large Speculators**: Primarily commodity funds trading billions of dollars. They are trend followers -- buying on scale-up, selling on scale-down. Their positioning is difficult to use predictively because they build and exit positions gradually over time.

3. **Commercials**: Producers and users of the commodity -- the industry itself. They represent the smartest money in the market. They are not trend followers; they are hedgers who use futures to facilitate their business. They have the deepest understanding of supply/demand fundamentals.

### Williams COT Index

Williams developed a proprietary index to normalize commercial positioning into a 0-100% scale, making it comparable across time periods and markets:

**Interpretation**:
- **COT Index > 75%**: Commercials are heavily long relative to their recent history. This is a BUY setup. When the index is high, look for buy signals if the market is in an uptrend
- **COT Index < 25%**: Commercials are heavily short relative to their recent history. This is a SELL setup. Look for sell signals if the market is in a downtrend
- **COT Index 25-75%**: Neutral zone. No strong directional bias from commercial positioning

### Practical Example: Gold 2011

In early February 2011, the Commercials were heavy buyers in Gold, increasing their long positions week after week. The COT index was well above 75%. The subsequent rally produced almost $22,000 per contract of profit. The Commercials moved the price -- this had nothing to do with chart formations, waves, or astrology.

### Soybeans COT Application

On a weekly chart, buying when the COT index rises above 75% during uptrends and selling when it falls below 25% during downtrends captured major swings worth $10,000+ per contract multiple times from 2009-2011.

### COT Limitations

- The report has a time lag (released end of week based on Tuesday data)
- Its forecasting power is longer-term in nature -- not specific to 1-2 day windows
- Best used as a SETUP condition (background bias) rather than a precise entry trigger
- Must be combined with shorter-term timing tools (TDW, volatility breakouts, patterns) for actionable trades

## Sentiment Analysis

### LW Sentiment Index

Williams developed his own Sentiment Index measuring the percentage of advisors, websites, and newsletters that are bullish or bearish on a market. The logic mirrors contrarian investing:

- **When the index is LOW (advisors bearish)**: Expect rallies. The crowd that is usually wrong is positioned for decline, meaning the opposite is likely
- **When the index is HIGH (advisors bullish)**: Expect declines. Near-unanimous bullishness means everyone who can buy has already bought -- there is no fuel left for further advance

### Extreme Readings

When 0% of advisors are bullish (maximum bearishness), this has historically coincided with significant price bottoms. Conversely, when 90%+ of advisors are bullish, the market is at extreme risk of reversal.

## 18-Day Moving Average Trend Change Signal

### Signal Definition

A definitive trend change is signaled when 2 consecutive bars trade entirely above (or below) an 18-day simple moving average:

**Bullish Trend Change**: 2 consecutive days where the Low of each day is ABOVE the 18-day MA. Not just the close above -- the entire bar must be above the MA.

**Bearish Trend Change**: 2 consecutive days where the High of each day is BELOW the 18-day MA. The entire bar must be below.

### Significance

This is a much stricter condition than the typical "close above MA" signal. By requiring the entire price bar to clear the MA for two consecutive days, it filters out the noise of whipsaw moves around the average. When this signal fires, it confirms genuine trend establishment.

## Price Behavior Truths

### Truth 1: Buy Strong Closes

**Rule**: If price closes in the upper 65% of the day's range, buy on that close.

Williams tested this across all major markets using exit periods of 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 days. Results for S&P 500:
- 5-day hold: $95,745 profit, 53% accuracy, 533 trades
- 10-day hold: $86,507 profit, 53% accuracy, 334 trades
- 15-day hold: $133,745 profit, 56% accuracy, 537 trades
- 20-day hold: $152,115 profit, 54% accuracy, 199 trades ($764/trade average)

This simple pattern worked across ALL markets tested -- more reliable than any individual candlestick formation. The lesson: buying strong markets is a GOOD habit. The public's instinct to sell strength and buy weakness leads to bankruptcy in trading.

### Truth 2: Buy New Highs

**Rule**: If today's high is below the highest high of the past X days and tomorrow price makes a new X-day high, buy.

Results for S&P 500 with various breakout periods:
- 1-day breakout: $106,945 profit, 58% accuracy, 209 trades ($511/trade)
- 5-day breakout: $67,197 profit, 51% accuracy, 187 trades
- 15-day breakout: $75,325 profit, 56% accuracy, 145 trades ($519/trade)
- 20-day breakout: $55,342 profit, 53% accuracy, 136 trades

New highs are NOT overbought -- they are evidence of strength. More money has been made buying new highs and selling new lows than with any other technique in trading history. The converse is equally true: more money has been LOST selling new highs and buying new lows.

### Truth 3: Limit Moves Continue

When a market closes limit up or limit down (or has an extraordinarily large-range day), the tendency is for CONTINUATION, not reversal. The public's instinct to sell a limit-up day or buy a limit-down day is consistently wrong. Strength begets strength until it exhausts itself.

## Long-Term Cyclical Context

Williams maintains long-term cyclical forecasts based on multi-decade pattern analysis:
- Markets experience huge upswings and huge downswings on long cycles
- No government or central bank can overcome long-term cyclical fluctuations
- The cyclical studies are useful for determining the MAGNITUDE potential of shorter-term signals
- A short-term buy signal during a cyclically bullish period should be traded more aggressively than one during a cyclically bearish period

The cycles are not precise time cycles (Williams spent 15 years proving time cycles are unreliable) but rather patterns of human behavior that repeat with varying magnitude and timing.

## The Five Tools Combined: Williams' Decision Framework

1. **COT Setup**: Is the smart money (Commercials) positioned in our direction? (>75% for buy, <25% for sell)
2. **Intermarket Confirmation**: Do Bonds support a stock trade? Does Gold support a Bond trade?
3. **TDW/TDM Alignment**: Is the calendar favorable for this trade?
4. **Overbought/Oversold**: Has the market pulled back enough to set up a volatility breakout?
5. **Pattern/Entry**: Does a specific bar pattern (Smash Day, Outside Day, etc.) provide a precise entry trigger?

The strongest trades occur when ALL FIVE elements align. Williams calls this a "stacked deck" -- the odds are overwhelmingly in your favor. When only 2-3 elements align, reduce position size. When fewer than 2 align, pass on the trade entirely.

## Script Output Interpretation Guide

### Market Context Output

When interpreting intermarket and macro analysis:
- **Bond-Stock alignment**: Check whether Bond market action (channel breakouts, trend direction) supports the direction of your intended stock trade. If Bonds are making new 14-day highs, this is a strong tailwind for S&P longs
- **Gold-Bond alignment**: If Gold is declining (below 20-24 day levels), this supports Bond buying. If Gold is rallying strongly, Bond longs should be approached with caution
- **COT reading**: Look for the Williams COT Index level. Above 75 = bullish setup zone for that market. Below 25 = bearish setup zone. Between 25-75 = no strong directional bias from commercial positioning
- **Sentiment reading**: Extreme advisor bearishness (low sentiment) is contrarian bullish. Extreme bullishness is contrarian bearish. Do not trade in the same direction as a crowd reading above 80% or below 20%
- **Convergence assessment**: Count how many of the five tools point in the same direction. 4-5 tools aligned = highest conviction. 2-3 tools aligned = moderate conviction. 0-1 tools aligned = no trade or minimal position

### Trend Context Output

When interpreting trend signals:
- **18-day MA relationship**: Has the market produced 2 consecutive bars entirely above/below the 18-day MA? If yes, trend change is confirmed. If not, any entry is counter-trend and should use tighter stops
- **Swing point status**: Where is the market relative to the most recent intermediate swing high/low? Trading in the direction of higher intermediate lows (uptrend) or lower intermediate highs (downtrend) has the highest probability
- **Close position in range**: Is the close consistently in the upper 65% of the daily range? If yes, momentum is with the bulls. Buying on pullbacks to the open or low is the optimal strategy. If close is consistently in the lower 35%, bears are in control
- **New high/low proximity**: Is the market near a new multi-day high or low? New highs are bullish evidence to be bought, not sold. The public's fear of new highs is the informed trader's opportunity
