### Added
- **[HARD] Truncation Recovery Rule** in `SKILL.md` — Prevents cascading failures when `extract_docstring.py` output exceeds 30KB and gets truncated by the system. Forces Claude to read the saved full-output file before executing any script, eliminating subcommand guessing from partial previews.
