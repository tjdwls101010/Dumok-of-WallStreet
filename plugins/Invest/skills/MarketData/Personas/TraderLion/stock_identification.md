# TraderLion Stock Identification

## Overview

Systematic framework for identifying high-potential growth stocks through volume edges, Relative Strength analysis, catalyst identification, and actionable setup recognition. Each edge and setup includes precise detection conditions and interpretation guidelines. The more edges a stock exhibits simultaneously, the stronger the evidence for institutional accumulation and potential outperformance.

> "A proper setup is not necessarily special because of its ability to always produce strong returns consistently, but rather because it allows traders to manage risk tightly and logically."

## TIGERS Stock Selection Framework

TIGERS is the proprietary acronym summarizing the six dimensions evaluated when selecting stocks. It is TraderLion's adaptation of CANSLIM, providing the holistic evaluation framework for stock identification. Every stock analysis should be evaluated against all six dimensions. A stock meeting multiple TIGERS criteria simultaneously presents the highest probability opportunity.

### T — Theme

The stock is riding a strong growth theme driven by larger forces.

- **Two types**: **Transformative** (technology-driven, long-lasting, multiple innovation waves -- e.g. semiconductors, internet, AI) and **Cyclical** (economic cycle/macro driven, shorter-lived, less meaningful opportunities -- e.g. energy, construction, banks, airlines).
- Transformative themes produce longer-lasting, more meaningful opportunities.
- **Potential Leadership Groups (PLGs)**: Stocks move in groups. A few PLGs make up current market cycle leadership. Even average stocks in strong groups can outperform the strongest stocks in mediocre groups. The goal is to identify the top 1-3 stocks within the current transformative theme of the cycle.
- **Three-wave alignment**: For a "special stock," three waves must align: (1) a healthy general market creating trends, (2) a disruptive theme attracting institutional accumulation, and (3) a specific company best positioned to profit. When all three waves combine, the result is maximum potential.

### I — Innovation

The company has a standout product, service, or element separating it from peers.

- Unique value proposition leading to rapid growth and market share capture.
- New product leveraging proprietary technology or unique approach to solving customer problems.
- Try to experience the company/product firsthand for unique insight.
- **Critical rule**: However deep the research, if price action does not confirm the thesis, look elsewhere.

### G — Growth

Currently growing earnings and sales rapidly, or projected to in upcoming quarters.

- Minimum quarterly growth: **>25% YoY** in earnings or sales.
- Preferred: **triple-digit growth** and/or **accelerating** across sequential quarters.
- **Acceleration pattern**: Growth rate increasing from quarter to quarter (e.g. 25% -> 40% -> 80%). This acceleration signal is one of the most powerful confirmations of emerging institutional interest. Track not just the latest quarter but the sequential trend of quarterly EPS and sales growth rates.
- Revenue growth is particularly important for growth-at-all-cost companies that may forgo profits.
- Profits should be on the near horizon; during tighter monetary cycles, markets may focus solely on profitable companies.

### E — Edges

The chart displays at least one of the recognized technical edges indicating institutional accumulation.

- Accumulation must show up in the charts.
- Stock should trend orderly when market is strong, fight downtrends, bounce quickly after corrections.
- Gaps up on earnings, breaks out and trends from base patterns.
- Looking for a rising leader already showing outperformance -- not a beaten-down stock.
- See the Volume Edges, Relative Strength Edge, and N-Factor Edge sections below for detailed edge definitions.

### R — Relative Strength

The stock is displaying unusual strength, outperformance, momentum, and trend.

- Should jump out; close to the top of leaderboards in 3-month RS.
- Continues to trend and obey moving averages.
- Large gap ups, respect for MAs, leading the market in the cycle.
- See the Relative Strength Edge section below for detection criteria.

### S — Setup

The stock is forming an actionable setup.

- Wait until the stock develops a setup you have studied and can trade effectively.
- Specialization: master 1-3 setups rather than trying to learn everything at once.
- See the Setups section below for setup definitions (Launch Pad, Gapper, Base Breakout).

---

## Volume Edges

Volume signatures indicate that a stock is undergoing a potential significant character change. A gap up on extremely large volume can lead to a strong momentum move and/or a long-term new trend.

### HVE — Highest Volume Ever

**Definition**: The trading day's volume exceeds the maximum volume ever recorded for the stock across its entire trading history.

**Detection Conditions**:
- Volume today > Maximum volume of all historical trading days
- Closing range >40%
- Stock is up on the day
- Minimum $3M dollar volume

**Interpretation**: Represents the most extreme institutional interest signal. When paired with a game-changing catalyst (first-time profitability, revolutionary product launch, industry-level regulatory change), this often marks the beginning of a new long-term trend. HVE is the strongest of the three HV edges.

**Follow-Through Confirmation**: If the stock rises the next trading day on even higher volume than the HVE day, the character change is confirmed. This is a strong additional signal of sustained institutional demand.

**Caution**: Biotech stocks frequently appear on HVE screens due to drug trial news — these often gap up but go nowhere. Prefer stocks in other industries with catalysts that translate directly to sustained earnings and sales growth.

*Apply this framework independently to the current analysis target.*

### HVIPO — Highest Volume Since IPO Week

**Definition**: The trading day's volume exceeds the maximum volume recorded since the stock's IPO week (excluding the IPO week itself, which typically has anomalous volume).

**Detection Conditions**:
- Volume today > Maximum volume since IPO week
- Closing range >40%
- Stock is up on the day
- Minimum $3M dollar volume

**Interpretation**: Indicates that institutional interest has reached a level not seen since the initial public offering excitement. Particularly meaningful for stocks that have been public for at least 6-12 months, as it suggests a fundamental re-evaluation by the market. The longer the time since IPO, the more significant this signal becomes.

**Follow-Through Confirmation**: If the stock rises the next trading day on even higher volume than the HVIPO day, the character change is confirmed. This is a strong additional signal of sustained institutional demand.

*Apply this framework independently to the current analysis target.*

---

### HV1 — Highest Volume in 1 Year

**Definition**: The trading day's volume exceeds the maximum volume recorded over the prior 250 trading days.

**Detection Conditions**:
- Volume today > Maximum volume of past 250 trading days
- Closing range >40%
- Stock is up on the day
- Minimum $3M dollar volume

**Interpretation**: The most frequently occurring HV edge. Signals that something has materially changed in how institutions view the stock. Most effective when associated with a game-changing catalyst. Look for follow-through — if the stock rises the next day on even higher volume, the character change is confirmed.

**Screen Logic**: Volume > Max(Volume, 250 days); DCR > 40%; % Change > 0; Dollar Volume > $3M

*Apply this framework independently to the current analysis target.*

---

### Increasing Average Volume

**Definition**: A sustained, step-function increase in the stock's average daily trading volume, typically coinciding with the early stages of a major move.

**Detection Conditions**:
- Average volume trending upward over weeks or months
- Step-change increases visible during base formation
- Further volume increase as stock begins its uptrend
- Large weekly volume spikes appearing with increasing frequency

**Interpretation**: Indicates the stock is becoming more liquid and attracting more institutional participants. Institutions managing billions need sufficient liquidity to build positions of tens of millions of dollars. As more institutions become involved, average daily volume increases and large weekly volume spikes appear. This change in supply/demand dynamics positively contributes to sustained price trends.

**Key Distinction from HV Edges**: HV edges are single-day events. Increasing Average Volume is a multi-week/month trend that provides context and confirmation.

See SKILL.md -> Technical, Screening

## Relative Strength Edge

### RS Line Interpretation

**Definition**: The Relative Strength (RS) line plots the ratio of the stock's price divided by an index (typically SPY). It is fundamentally different from the RSI (Relative Strength Index).

**Key Principle**: The absolute value of the RS line is not meaningful — the trend is what matters.
- Uptrend = outperformance versus the index
- Downtrend = underperformance versus the index

**Most Powerful Signal**: RS line making new highs before the stock's price makes new highs. This is a hallmark of future market leaders observed cycle after cycle in model book studies.

### RS Days

**Definition**: A day where the stock outperforms the market (positive relative performance), tracked especially during market corrections.

**Detection Criteria**:
- During a market correction, count the percentage of days the stock outperformed the market
- **Threshold**: >60% RS days during a correction indicates strong institutional accumulation

### RS Edge Detection — Five Manifestations

1. **RS Line Uptrend**: The RS line is trending upward and ideally making new highs, indicating persistent outperformance
2. **High RS Day Percentage**: On over 60% of days during a correction, the stock outperforms the market
3. **MA Maintenance**: The stock holds above key moving averages (21 EMA, 50 SMA) as the market undercuts them
4. **Divergent Higher Lows**: During the later part of a correction, the stock ignores market pullbacks and forms higher lows as the market forms lower lows
5. **Spring Release Recovery**: As the market moves up the right side after consolidating, the stock "jumps up" and recovers faster — as if pressure on a spring has been released

**RS Timing Principle**: Stocks showing RS especially during the **last third** of a correction are the most likely to become leaders of the next uptrend. Leaders will reclaim MAs and make new highs ahead of the indexes.

### MA Maintenance Criteria

The following moving averages are monitored for RS analysis:
- **10-day SMA**: Short-term trend; sustained trending stocks hold this during strong momentum phases
- **21-day EMA**: Key swing-trading support; holding this during corrections is a strong RS signal
- **50-day SMA**: Medium-term institutional reference; first major support level for position traders
- **65-day EMA**: Secondary medium-term reference
- **200-day SMA**: Long-term trend definition; price must be above this for a valid Stage 2 uptrend

**Strength Ranking**: A stock that holds the 21 EMA while the market undercuts the 50 SMA demonstrates exceptional relative strength and is a top candidate for leadership in the next uptrend.

### Three-Month Absolute Strength Rankings

During normal uptrends, use three-month RS rankings (percentile scale) to identify the strongest stocks. Stocks ranking >85th percentile in 3-month RS are primary candidates. Additionally, scan for stocks gapping up or moving higher on volume — any standout price action.

See SKILL.md -> Technical, Screening

---

## N-Factor Edge

### Game-Changing Catalyst Identification Framework

**Definition**: A fundamental catalyst that dramatically changes how institutions evaluate a company, leading to sustained accumulation and a significant stock advance. Derived from the "N" in O'Neil's CANSLIM methodology.

**Catalyst Categories**:

1. **Earnings/Revenue Surprise**: Company dramatically beats expectations and raises forward guidance. Forces institutions to re-model and accumulate. Most effective when EPS growth is triple-digit or shows acceleration across sequential quarters (e.g. 25% -> 40% -> 80%). Track not just the latest quarter but the sequential trend of quarterly EPS and sales growth rates alongside EPS surprise percentages.

2. **Industry-Level Regulatory Change**: Regulation changes that allow significant new development and growth across an entire sector. Focus on the strongest stock in the group, not laggards.

3. **Technology Breakthrough**: Advances creating entirely new industries (e.g., AI emergence driven by hardware and software advances). These transformative themes can produce multiple waves of opportunity over years.

4. **Revolutionary Product/Service**: Company reinvents itself through a new offering (e.g., Netflix's transition from mail-order DVDs to streaming to original content). Each reinvention can trigger a new multi-month uptrend.

**Validation Requirement**: The N-Factor must be directly leading to growth in earnings and sales. Talk of future potential without current financial impact (e.g., early autonomous driving narratives) does not qualify until institutions confirm with buying, visible in price and volume action.

**Key Principle**: However compelling the story, if institutional accumulation is not visible in the price action, do not act. Return when the market starts taking notice.

## Setups

Setups are larger chart patterns that take weeks to form but yield trends that can last months. Each setup must provide a clearly defined entry level and a corresponding failure level for tight risk management.

### Launch Pad Setup

**Definition**: A bottoming pattern formed when all key moving averages converge and the stock begins to consolidate and shape up.

**Conditions for Identification**:
- **MA Convergence**: The 10-day SMA, 21-day EMA, 50-day SMA, 65-day EMA, and 200-day SMA all come together tightly beneath or at the price level
- **Group Confirmation**: Particularly significant when an entire group of stocks in the same theme forms launch pads simultaneously — this signals the beginning of a group move
- **Context**: Typically forms after significant market corrections and bear markets as stocks form bottoms
- **Price Action**: Stock begins to consolidate and trade tightly within the converging MAs

**Entry Approach**: Look for clear consolidation pivots and entry tactics within the launch pad that allow risk management against the converged MAs.

**Risk Management**: Stop loss placed below the cluster of converged moving averages. Because the MAs are converged, this provides a tight and logical stop level.

**Significance**: One of TraderLion's core setups. It identifies the transition point where a stock shifts from a bottoming/basing phase to the beginning of a new uptrend. Early recognition provides the lowest-risk entry point in the entire subsequent move.

*Apply this framework independently to the current analysis target.*

---

### Gapper Setup

**Definition**: A gap-up day on large volume with a catalyst, creating the foundation for a momentum continuation trade.

**Conditions for Identification**:
- **Gap-Up**: Stock opens significantly above prior day's close
- **Volume**: Trading on extremely high volume relative to average (ideally qualifying as HVE, HVIPO, or HV1)
- **Closing Range >50%**: The stock closes in the upper half of its daily range, indicating buyers maintained control throughout the session
- **Catalyst Present**: Must be accompanied by a game-changing fundamental catalyst (earnings surprise, new product, industry change)
- **Trend Context**: Preferably occurring within an existing uptrend or at the emergence from a base

**Multiple Gapper Protocol**:
- Focus on the **first one or two** gappers in a stock's trend
- Later in the trend, momentum deteriorates and gaps may be sold into as institutions take profit
- **Exception**: A later gapper is actionable if (a) it follows a significant base formation, or (b) the first gap occurred very low in a base structure

**Growth Confirmation**: Gappers are most powerful when accompanied by accelerating EPS growth. Track sequential quarterly EPS growth and EPS surprise percentages.

*Apply this framework independently to the current analysis target.*

---

### Base Breakout Setup (Including VCP)

**Definition**: A classic continuation setup where a stock breaks through a line of resistance after a multi-week consolidation within a longer-term uptrend.

**Conditions for Identification**:
- **Minimum Duration**: At least five weeks of consolidation
- **Trend Context**: Must be within the context of a longer-term uptrend (continuation, not reversal)
- **Tightening Action**: The healthiest bases tighten in price range and volume from left to right (this tightening pattern within a base is the core of the Volatility Contraction Pattern — VCP)
- **Volume Pattern**: Volume dries up during the base, then picks up sharply on the breakout — these are the "elephant tracks" of large institutions
- **Clean Resistance Break**: Price moves cleanly through a clearly defined line of horizontal resistance

**VCP Characteristics**:
- Successive contractions in price range within the base
- Each pullback within the base is shallower than the previous one
- Volume contracts with each successive contraction
- The final contraction is the tightest, creating the launch point

**Entry Considerations**:
- In recent markets, breakout failures are more common than in the 1990s
- **Alternative early entry**: Enter as the stock moves up toward the breakout level rather than waiting for the breach
- **Alternative pullback entry**: Enter when a stock stalls after breakout and falls back to a key MA (particularly the 21 EMA), then resets

**Double-Bottom Variant**: Shakeouts within a base can form double bottoms, which are actionable base breakout patterns. The double bottom provides a clear support level for stop placement. The second low that holds or slightly undercuts the first low, then reverses, confirms demand at that price area.

**Focus Prioritization**: Like the gapper, focus on the first few bases in a stock's longer-term move to ensure remaining runway.

### Base Count and Quality Degradation

Track the sequential base number within a single trend cycle. Each stock resets to "1st base" after a significant decline that breaks the trend structure (price breaks below the 200 SMA and forms a new base).

| Base Number | Quality | Probability Assessment |
|---|---|---|
| 1st base | Highest | Full position sizing, broadest stop tolerance |
| 2nd base | High | Full position sizing, standard stops |
| 3rd base | Moderate | Reduced sizing (75%), tighter stops |
| 4th base | Low | Half sizing maximum, very tight stops |
| 5th+ base | Lowest | Monitor only, or minimal test position |

This degradation schedule is strongly supported by case studies across all market cycles 2004-2024. Late-stage base failures are the most common failure mode for stocks that were prior market leaders.

*Apply this framework independently to the current analysis target.*

## Closing Range and Bar Classification

### Daily Closing Range (DCR) Calculation

**Formula**: DCR = ((Close - Low) / (High - Low)) x 100

**Interpretation**:
- **DCR = 100%**: Stock closed at the high of the day — maximum buying pressure
- **DCR = 0%**: Stock closed at the low of the day — maximum selling pressure
- **DCR > 50%**: Closed in the upper half of the range — buyers controlled the session
- **DCR < 50%**: Closed in the lower half of the range — sellers controlled the session

### Constructive vs Non-Constructive Bar Classification

A bar's quality is determined by the combination of its direction, closing range, and volume level relative to the moving average. This three-dimensional classification replaces narrative descriptions with a precise decision matrix.

| Classification | Day Type | Closing Range | Volume Level | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Constructive** | Up Day | >50% | Below Average | Light buying, controlled accumulation |
| **Constructive** | Up Day | >50% | Average | Normal buying, positive |
| **Constructive** | Up Day | >50% | Above Average | Strong buying, institutional demand |
| **Constructive** | Down Day | Any | Below Average | Lack of sellers, minor pullback |
| **Non-Constructive** | Up Day | <50% | Average | Buyers lost control, faded into close |
| **Non-Constructive** | Up Day | <50% | Above Average | Heavy selling into rally, distribution |
| **Non-Constructive** | Down Day | <50% | Above Average | Institutional selling, distribution day |

**Additional Non-Constructive Signals**:
- Stock closes below key MAs on high volume
- Gap-up days that fade and close in the lower portion of the range
- Climax-top behavior: acceleration upward on extreme volume after a major advance, then reversal to close red — signals end of the move

**Time-Frame Hierarchy Principle**: Single bar analysis must always be viewed in context of higher time frames. A weekly closing range contextualizes daily bars; daily contextualizes intraday. A poorly closing 5-minute bar on Friday does not matter if the weekly has 95% closing range, just broke out of a large base, and is making new highs.

### Application

Track the ratio of constructive to non-constructive bars over rolling periods. A stock transitioning from predominantly constructive to non-constructive bars is undergoing a character change from accumulation to distribution, regardless of whether the overall price level still appears high.

### Positive Expectation Breaker

**Definition**: A stock positioned in a structurally bearish configuration (below key MAs, forming lower highs, near breakdown level) that instead breaks out to the upside, defying the bearish expectation.

**Detection Conditions**:
- Stock is below the 21 EMA or has formed at least one lower high
- Price is near a breakdown level (base pivot, prior swing low)
- Instead of breaking down, stock closes above a prior swing high or resistance level on the same day or within 2 days
- Closing range on the breakout day >50%
- Volume on breakout day above average

**Interpretation**: Represents hidden institutional accumulation that was not visible in the price structure. The bearish expectation trapped short sellers and weak holders; the upside break creates a short squeeze and forces re-evaluation. One of the most powerful continuation signals observed across 120+ annotated market leader charts spanning 2004-2024.

**Key Distinction**: Different from a simple range breakout because the structural context was bearish. The "positive expectation" is the market's expectation of further decline that was "broken."

### No Follow-Through Down

**Definition**: A bearish event (gap down, support break, distribution day) that fails to produce sustained downside within 1-3 trading days.

**Detection Conditions**:
- Stock experiences a bearish event: gap down >2%, break below key MA, break below base pivot, or high-volume down day
- Within 1-3 days, stock recovers above the event trigger level
- Recovery occurs on constructive volume (up day volume > down day volume)

**Interpretation**: Institutional buyers absorbed the selling pressure generated by the bearish event. This is a demand signal — there is more buying interest than the visible supply. Frequently precedes renewed upside. Approximately 30% of annotated winning charts display this pattern at least once during their base formation or early trend phase.

### Inside Day and Tight Day Setup Bars

**Inside Day Definition**: A day where the high is lower than the prior day's high AND the low is higher than the prior day's low. The entire day's range fits within the prior day's range.

**Tight Day Definition**: A day where the range (high - low) is less than 50% of the 20-day Average Daily Range.

**Double Inside Day**: Two consecutive inside days. A particularly powerful setup bar configuration.

**Interpretation**: Both patterns signal volatility contraction — the market for this stock has reached temporary equilibrium. The direction of the subsequent expansion (the day that breaks the inside day's range or the tight day's range) has high continuation probability.

**Highest Value When**:
- Occurring at or near a key moving average (21 EMA, 50 SMA)
- Occurring at or near a base pivot level
- Occurring after a constructive pullback within an uptrend
- Low volume on the inside/tight day itself (supply dried up)

**Detection**: Flag inside days and tight days occurring within 3% of a key MA or base pivot. Assign higher setup quality score when these conditions are met.

See SKILL.md -> Technical, Screening

## Opportunity Zones

Three lifecycle zones where stocks commonly double and triple. Knowing which zone a stock is in sets expectations for behavior, volatility, and appropriate setup types.

### IPO Boom Zone

The first opportunity zone, occurring right after IPO. Often begins with an IPO base (short consolidation of a few days to weeks). Can produce high-momentum moves especially if the stock is part of a current leadership group or theme. This zone is short-lived and volatile.

**Supply/Demand Dynamic**: During the lock-up period, many holders are restricted from selling, creating high trend potential with strong demand. Once the lock-up ends, insiders sell, secondary offerings increase supply, leading to a drawdown and an "institutional due diligence phase."

### Growth Transition Zone

After the initial IPO drawdown, the stock establishes a trading range and begins a new longer-term uptrend. Institutions have researched the company and begun accumulating. The stock is often showing first signs of profitability.

**What to Watch For**: IPOs 6-12 months old, part of a leading theme, just turning profitable or posting strong growth. This zone often lines up with the appearance of the 200-day SMA. Look for base breakouts off the bottom or along the trend toward previous highs.

### New Momentum Zone

Can occur multiple times during a stock's lifetime. After declining or basing for an extended period, the stock forms a base and begins a new strong Stage 2 uptrend. Often occurs after the market experiences a longer-term basing or correctional period. Most powerful when associated with a catalyst and a leading theme.

## Stock Character Assessment

Each stock has its own patterns of movement driven by supply/demand dynamics and the major participants involved. Understanding a stock's character before entry sets expectations for how to manage the position.

### ADR% (Average Daily Range)

**Calculation**: Average of (High - Low) / Close over a lookback period, expressed as a percentage.

**Preferred Threshold**: 3-5% minimum for growth/momentum trading. At this level, stocks can make powerful moves in just a few weeks. ADR% expresses volatility in a comparable way across different share prices.

### Clean Trenders vs Choppy Traders

- **Clean trenders**: Orderly transitions from uptrends to downtrends, respecting trend lines and MAs, few gap downs. Preferred — easier to manage, position in, and stay in.
- **Choppy traders**: Frequent gap ups and gap downs, lack tight areas, little respect for MAs. Example: oil/gas companies influenced by the underlying commodity. Both types can make great moves, but clean trenders are significantly easier to trade within the TraderLion framework.

### Character Change Signals

A character change occurs when a catalyst fundamentally changes a company or industry. Institutions recalibrate models and allocate capital accordingly. The change shows up as:
- Large volume increase and powerful price moves
- The stock may develop newfound respect for MAs and trade more cleanly
- Transition from choppy to orderly price action

### Liquidity, Float, and Life Cycle Context

- **Dollar Volume** (Avg Shares Traded x Current Price): More liquid stocks produce cleaner trends, tighter bid-ask spreads, less jumpy action, and more respect for key levels and MAs. Institutions need sufficient liquidity to build tens-of-millions-dollar positions.
- **Float**: Lower float = more volatile. Higher float = gentler moves.
- **Life Cycle**: Recent IPOs are more volatile pre-lock-up due to restricted float. Post lock-up and after secondary offerings, stocks mature and become more liquid.

## Winning Characteristics Checklist

The complete checklist of characteristics that high-potential growth stocks exhibit. The more items checked, the higher the probability of a significant advance and the larger the warranted position size.

### Price/Volume Signatures

Based on studies of top-performing stocks from the mid-1990s onwards, almost all stocks that double and triple share these seven price and volume signatures. These are the observation-level patterns that provide the foundation for the detailed detection-level criteria in the 12-item checklist below.

1. **Increase in Average Volume** — A distinct step-up in average daily volume as institutions accumulate. Often begins at the start of a new uptrend or after a transformative earnings report.
2. **Huge Volume Spikes** — Highest volume in a year or more on the daily chart; large up-weeks on the weekly chart. Key moments: base breakouts, earnings reports. "Volume = Price, Cause = Effect."
3. **Tight Areas on Low Volume** — During trends and consolidation, the stock pauses and forms tight ranges with low volume — equilibrium in supply/demand, signifying lack of sellers and subtle institutional accumulation. The stock stair-steps: expand up, go tight, expand up, go tight, repeat.
4. **Respect for Moving Averages** — Strong leaders hold specific key MAs for extended periods. Loss of that respect signals the move is near the end or the stock needs to build a longer base. Note which MA the stock respects — this is part of the stock's character.
5. **Powerful Prior Moves** — Winning stocks often continue to win. Stocks with strong recent trends can perform again after a base or corrective period. If the left side of the chart shows weak or choppy trading, do not expect a clean trend unless a full character change is visible.
6. **Gap Ups** — A key signature of market leaders. Stocks making 200-500%+ moves often have multiple gap ups. Early gaps in a move have higher probability of maturing into a sustained trend.
7. **Relative Strength** — Leaders stand out during corrections — going sideways or advancing while the market pulls in. Can be observed via the RS line or screened using RS rating and absolute strength ranking.

### Fundamental Characteristics

1. **Theme Alignment**: Stock is part of a current leading transformative or cyclical theme with visible group strength
2. **Innovation / N-Factor**: Company possesses a standout, game-changing competitive advantage driving institutional interest
3. **Quarterly EPS Growth >25% YoY**: Ideally triple-digit and accelerating across sequential quarters (e.g. 25% -> 40% -> 80%). Track the sequential trend of quarterly EPS growth rates — acceleration is a key confirmation pattern.
4. **Quarterly Sales Growth >25% YoY**: Revenue growth confirming demand, especially critical for growth-at-all-cost companies. Acceleration in sales growth across sequential quarters strengthens the signal.
5. **EPS/Revenue Surprises**: Consistent positive surprises forcing institutional re-evaluation and accumulation. Track sequential EPS surprise percentages alongside growth rates.
6. **Strong Forward Estimates**: Next-quarter EPS growth estimates also exceeding 30%, confirming sustainability

### Technical Characteristics

7. **HV Edge Present**: At least one of HVE, HVIPO, or HV1 observed on a catalyst day
8. **Increasing Average Volume**: Multi-week trend of rising average daily volume and large weekly volume spikes indicating growing institutional participation
9. **RS Line Uptrend / New Highs**: Relative Strength line trending upward, ideally making new highs before price — the hallmark of future leaders
10. **RS Days >60%**: During market corrections, the stock outperforms the market on more than 60% of trading days
11. **MA Respect and Maintenance**: Stock holds above key MAs (especially 21 EMA, 50 SMA) during market pullbacks while broader market undercuts
12. **Actionable Setup Formation**: Stock is forming or has completed one of the mastered setups (Launch Pad, Gapper, or Base Breakout) with a clearly defined entry and tight logical stop level

### Scoring Guidance

- **0-3 characteristics**: Low conviction — monitor only
- **4-6 characteristics**: Moderate conviction — base position sizing (10%)
- **7-9 characteristics**: High conviction — increased position sizing (12.5-17.5%)
- **10-12 characteristics**: Highest conviction — maximum position sizing (20%)

## Head-to-Head Comparison Framework

When comparing two or more stocks (Type G query: "A vs B?"), use this structured 7-axis comparison to determine which candidate offers a superior risk-adjusted entry.

### Comparison Axes

| Axis | What to Evaluate | Scoring |
|------|-----------|---------|
| 1. Edge Count | Volume edge detection + RS ranking + earnings data | Count of edges present (0-6). More edges = stronger institutional conviction. |
| 2. RS Score | RS percentile ranking | Percentile ranking (0-99). Higher = stronger relative performance vs market. |
| 3. Winning Characteristics | See checklist above | Score out of 12. Higher = more complete growth stock profile. |
| 4. Setup Maturity | VCP quality assessment + base count | VCP quality (high/moderate/low) + base number (1st > 2nd > 3rd). Earlier bases with higher quality VCP preferred. |
| 5. Base Count & Risk | Base count analysis | 1st base = lowest risk, 4th+ = highest risk. Prefer stocks in earlier bases. |
| 6. Volume Grade | Volume accumulation/distribution grading | A+ through E. Higher grade = stronger accumulation evidence. |
| 7. Constructive Ratio | Closing range bar classification | Ratio of constructive bars over 20 days. >0.6 = healthy accumulation. |

### Comparison Output Format

Present as a side-by-side table:

| Axis | {SYMBOL_A} | {SYMBOL_B} | Winner |
|------|-----------|-----------|--------|
| Edge Count | {count_a} ({list}) | {count_b} ({list}) | {winner} |
| RS Score | {rs_a} | {rs_b} | {winner} |
| Winning Chars | {wc_a}/12 | {wc_b}/12 | {winner} |
| Setup Maturity | {setup_a} | {setup_b} | {winner} |
| Base Count | #{base_a} ({risk_a}) | #{base_b} ({risk_b}) | {winner} |
| Volume Grade | {vol_a} | {vol_b} | {winner} |
| Constructive Ratio | {cr_a} | {cr_b} | {winner} |
| **Overall** | **{wins_a}/7** | **{wins_b}/7** | **{overall}** |

### Tiebreaker Rules

When axis wins are tied:
1. **Edge Count wins**: More edges = more institutional evidence. This is the primary tiebreaker.
2. **RS Score wins**: Stronger relative strength during corrections predicts future leadership.
3. **Setup Maturity wins**: Earlier base with better pattern quality offers more remaining upside.

### Comparison Protocol

1. Obtain SNIPE pipeline analysis for each symbol (see SKILL.md for execution details)
2. Extract data for all 7 axes
3. Build the comparison table
4. Count axis wins per symbol
5. Apply tiebreaker if needed
6. State clear recommendation with rationale: "Based on {N}/7 axis wins, {SYMBOL} is the stronger S.N.I.P.E. candidate because [specific edge/RS/setup advantage]."

### Limitations

- **Theme alignment (TIGERS T)** and **N-Factor catalyst quality** require agent-level judgment and cannot be scored purely from scripts. State these assessments as supplementary context alongside the 7-axis comparison.
- If both stocks are in AVOID/MONITOR signal territory, comparison is academic — neither should be traded. State this explicitly.
- A stock winning 7/7 axes is rare. In practice, 4-5/7 wins with a clear edge count advantage is a strong differentiation.

*Apply this framework independently to the current analysis target.*
