# TraderLion Analysis Methodology

## Overview

Momentum-based growth stock methodology combining systematic stock selection (TIGERS), structured workflow (S.N.I.P.E.), and disciplined risk management to identify and ride institutional-driven trends. Rooted in William O'Neil's CANSLIM tradition but evolved with proprietary edges, setups, and entry tactics developed through decades of collective market experience.

> "The goal with edges and setups is to define frameworks for identifying and entering high potential stocks at a point where if you are right, you will quickly be at a profit, and where if you are wrong, you will quickly be stopped out for a negligible loss."

> "We've learned to never fall in love with a stock, no matter how innovative the company seems or how charismatic the CEO may be."

## Core Philosophy

### Ride Institutional Waves

Individual retail investors cannot change the direction of a liquid stock for more than a few moments. The sustained trends visible in leading stocks are created by the largest funds and institutions managing billions of dollars. The core strategy is to identify and ride these institutional waves. Relatively small retail size is an advantage — it allows nimble entry and exit at points where institutions must build positions over weeks.

### Simplicity and Specialization

The best trading systems, routines, and rules are remarkably simple. Complexity adds randomness and confusion — fewer cogs to jam, more room to polish and improve. Focus on price action above all else; supplement with only a few key indicators. Any indicator used must help analyze or manage a trade, not add noise. Rules must be specific and clear. Routines must be easy to complete so they are actually followed consistently.

One style, one strategy — pick and master it. Build strict criteria for stock selection so you focus on the top 1% of stocks for your strategy. A handful of setups mastered deeply — this specialization builds confidence and repeatability.

### Plan for Failure

Build failure into the system. There will be periods where setups are ineffective, where bad luck leads to sequential losses. The system and psyche must be resilient enough to handle drawdowns. If the system holds during adversity, performance during favorable periods compounds dramatically.

### Manage Risk Tightly

Losses must be papercuts — small enough that a single winning trade can pay for many of them. Every entry must have both a tight and logical stop loss. The stop level must reflect an important technical level that the stock should not violate given its current momentum. The closer the failure level is to the entry point, the tighter the stop.

"If you can master this skill -- the ability to always enter with both a tight and logical stop loss in a high potential stock and setup -- you will succeed in the market."

### Think in Cycles

Both the market and individual stocks rise and fall in cycles created by supply and demand, fear, and greed. Trade in the right direction relative to the current market trend. Become aggressive at the right points of the cycle. The trader also goes through cycles of learning and testing — continuous improvement is non-negotiable.

## Price Action Foundations

### Chart Template

Keep charts clean and simple — less is more. No magic indicator combination. The standard template uses:

- **21-day EMA** — primary swing-trading trend reference
- **50-day MA** — medium-term institutional reference
- **200-day SMA** — long-term trend definition
- **Volume with a moving average** — for gauging relative volume significance
- **Relative measured volatility** — for identifying tight price contraction areas

### Daily Closing Range (DCR)

The Daily Closing Range quantifies where a stock closed within its daily range, expressing buying vs. selling pressure as a single number.

**Formula**: `DCR = (Close - Low) / (High - Low) x 100`

**Interpretation**:
- **>50%**: Buying pressure was stronger — the closer to 100%, the stronger the buyers
- **<50%**: Selling pressure was stronger — the closer to 0%, the stronger the sellers
- **50%**: Indecision / balance between buyers and sellers

### Constructive vs Non-Constructive Bar Classification

A single bar's quality is determined by the combination of its direction, closing range, and volume level. This three-dimensional classification provides the foundation for bar-by-bar analysis.

| Classification | Day Type | Closing Range | Volume Level | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Constructive** | Up Day | >50% | Below Average | Light buying, controlled accumulation |
| **Constructive** | Up Day | >50% | Average | Normal buying, positive |
| **Constructive** | Up Day | >50% | Above Average | Strong buying, institutional demand |
| **Constructive** | Down Day | Any | Below Average | Lack of sellers, minor pullback |
| **Non-Constructive** | Up Day | <50% | Average | Buyers lost control, faded into close |
| **Non-Constructive** | Up Day | <50% | Above Average | Heavy selling into rally, distribution |
| **Non-Constructive** | Down Day | <50% | Above Average | Institutional selling, distribution day |

Single bar price action should always be taken in context of the larger pattern. Higher time frames supersede lower ones. A poorly closing 5-minute bar on Friday does not matter if the weekly has 95% closing range, just broke out of a large base, and is making new highs.

### Volume Analysis Framework

**Volume Moving Averages**:
- **20-day SMA**: Standard reference for swing traders
- **50-day SMA**: Standard reference for position traders

**Significance Threshold**: Approximately 25% above or below the volume moving average marks a significant departure from normal activity. Also compare visually with the previous 5-10 bars. High or low volume is most significant in areas of similar action and during significant price expansions or contractions.

**Key Volume-Price Relationships**:
- During **contractions and bases**: Low volume = supply has dried up = more explosive eventual expansion. Volume gradually declines as equilibrium is reached and less supply comes to market.
- During **expansions and base breakouts**: High volume = high demand = more powerful trend. The combination confirms institutional participation.
- **Volume run rate**: Compares current session volume to average volume at that time of day (intraday metric for real-time assessment).

### Volatility Contraction

Price tightness acts as the coiling of a spring — the tighter a stock gets relative to its recent price action, the more explosive a momentum move is likely to be.

**Contraction Signals**:
- **Inside days**: Day's range is entirely within the prior day's range (narrower high-to-low)
- **Tight open and close**: Similar open and close values indicate equilibrium
- **Range compression**: A stock with a normal 5% average daily range forming days with only 2% range is compressing in volatility

**The Expand-Contract-Expand Pattern**: Markets alternate between consolidation periods and trends. From bases, consolidations, and contractions come momentum moves and trends. This pattern occurs on all time frames — intraday, daily, and monthly for multi-month setups.

---

## Trend Definition

### Method 1: Market Structure

**Swing Point Definition**: A turning point where a high or low is not overtaken for at least 3 bars.

- **Uptrend**: Stock makes higher swing highs AND higher swing lows
- **Downtrend**: Stock makes lower swing highs AND lower swing lows
- **Trend change**: When structure breaks — transition from higher highs/higher lows to lower highs/lower lows (or vice versa)

During an uptrend, short-term basing (a temporary lower high or lower low) does not break the uptrend until the stock truly changes character and breaks structure.

### Method 2: Moving Averages

- Stock above a **rising** moving average = uptrend for that period
- Stock below a **declining** moving average = downtrend for that period

**Moving Average Selection by Time Frame**:

| Time Frame | Recommended MA |
|---|---|
| Day trading | 5-day SMA (+ intraday MAs) |
| Swing trading | 10-day SMA or 21-day EMA |
| Position trading / Investing | 50-day SMA or 200-day SMA |

### Stocks Have Characters

Look left on the chart to see which MAs the stock respected in previous sustained moves. Use the MAs that keep you in the trade for your relevant time frame. Some stocks respect the 10-day, some the 21 EMA, some the 50 SMA — this is part of the stock's character.

SMA vs EMA: the distinction does not matter materially. Moving averages are reference points, not precise levels. Stocks often slightly undercut MAs before finding support.

### Institutional Accumulation Levels

The **50-day SMA / 10-week SMA** and the **200-day SMA / 40-week SMA** are areas where institutions look to accumulate or add to positions. These levels are worth watching because a large number of market participants monitor them. Institutional buying near these levels creates support that can be observed and anticipated.

---

## Multiple Time Frame Analysis

### Fractal Market Principle

The market is fractal — trends and patterns occur on all time frames. The same structural principles (swing points, trend definition, base formation, breakouts) apply whether looking at 5-minute, daily, weekly, or monthly charts.

### Confluence

Trends and levels become more powerful when aligned on multiple time frames. A daily breakout through a level that aligns with a weekly or monthly key level involves participants from both time frames — this adds fuel and increases the likelihood of trend continuation.

When multiple key levels line up at the same price area, the probability of an actionable pattern increases significantly. Always watch for confluence across time frames.

### Higher Time Frame Levels as Trend Change Areas

Higher time frame levels are where trend changes can occur on lower time frames. A monthly swing low, for example, can support a new daily uptrend. A weekly resistance level can cap a daily advance.

**IPO High as Pivotal Level**: The all-time high from the IPO period is a pivotal higher-timeframe level for future analysis. When a stock returns to and breaks through its IPO high, it involves all time-frame participants and often marks a significant inflection point.

### Areas of Interest, Not Precise Lines

Think of levels as areas of interest rather than precise lines. Price may undershoot or overshoot slightly. The key is whether the stock responds to the general area, not whether it touches an exact number.

## The S.N.I.P.E. Workflow

S.N.I.P.E. is the five-step systematic workflow for finding, evaluating, and executing trades. Each step progressively narrows the funnel from the total market down to a focused, actionable trade.

### Step 1: Search and Scan

**Definition**: Cast the widest net to surface stocks meeting the most general criteria.

**Purpose**: Build the initial universe of candidates from the full market. This is the largest part of the funnel.

**Action Guidelines**:
- Run universe screens with broad liquidity, dollar volume, and basic fundamental filters
- Target approximately 400-500 names in the universe
- Use both general screens (75-400 results) and specialist screens (<50 results)
- Run daily and weekly screen routines to maintain awareness
- Track the number of results over time — fluctuations reveal market breadth changes

### Step 2: Narrow

**Definition**: Focus attention only on stocks exhibiting edges and fitting tighter criteria.

**Purpose**: Reduce noise and concentrate on stocks with genuine institutional interest and high potential.

**Action Guidelines**:
- Filter for necessary fundamentals (TIGERS criteria)
- Look for theme alignment, story, momentum, and trend
- Scan for price and volume signatures (HV edges, RS characteristics)
- Reduce from hundreds down to approximately 75 weekly candidates

### Step 3: Identify

**Definition**: Finalize watchlists by analyzing each remaining opportunity for specific edges and setups that have been studied and thrive in the current environment.

**Purpose**: Ensure only stocks with studied, repeatable patterns survive to the actionable list.

**Action Guidelines**:
- Cross-reference each candidate against your edge checklist
- Confirm that the setup type matches current market conditions
- Verify that the stock is in the right stage of its trend for entry
- Build weekly focus list of maximum ~15 names

### Step 4: Plan

**Definition**: For actionable names, design the specific entry tactic, stop loss placement, and position size.

**Purpose**: Remove improvisation from execution. Every trade should have a pre-defined plan before the market opens.

**Action Guidelines**:
- Define exact entry level and corresponding failure level
- Calculate position size based on edge count and risk tolerance
- Set alerts for approach zones and trigger levels
- Prepare contingency plans for gap scenarios
- Document the plan before execution

### Step 5: Execute

**Definition**: Enter the trade while managing risk, then manage the position using pre-defined rules.

**Purpose**: Translate the plan into action with discipline — including both selling into strength and selling into weakness.

**Action Guidelines**:
- Execute the plan as designed; do not deviate based on emotion
- Monitor closing range and volume characteristics post-entry
- Apply position management rules (sell rules for strength and weakness)
- Track profit cushion for overnight hold decisions
- If stopped out but the overall setup remains valid, continue watching for re-entry

### Climax Top Recognition

**Pattern**: After a stock has already made a major move, it accelerates upward in a euphoric last push driven by greed. This climax top often marks the end of the rise of a model stock.

**Decision Rule**: When a climax top pattern forms, sell. Institutional investors are now net selling shares to the general crowd, leading to the inevitable end of the stock's move. No fundamental story, however compelling, overrides this signal.

**Benchmark**: SCHW -- 400% increase in 24 weeks, then fell 65% in 6 months and lost 87% during the subsequent bear market.

### Sell Philosophy: Technicals Override Fundamentals

"Although we buy based on both technicals and fundamentals, we must look to the charts to determine exactly when we should sell." Buy on technicals and fundamentals; sell on technicals ONLY.

Despite a great story and a seemingly glowing future, technicals reveal the raw truth about institutional activity. Fundamentals often deteriorate only after the stock has already fallen significantly from its highs. Never fall in love with a stock, no matter how innovative the company seems or how charismatic the CEO may be. Previously great stocks that rose tenfold can lose momentum and tumble 75%+ during downtrends.

### Undercut and Rally

**Definition**: A stock undercuts a prior established low (base low, pivot low, or moving average) then immediately rallies back above that level within 1-3 days.

**Interpretation**: The undercut stops out weak holders and triggers short selling. The rally back above the level forces shorts to cover and attracts new buyers, creating a surge of demand. This pattern frequently marks the final low before a breakout.

**Detection**: Prior low is established. Price dips below it by 1-3%. Price recovers above the prior low within 3 trading days. Recovery volume exceeds the undercut volume.

## TIGERS Stock Selection Criteria

TIGERS is the proprietary acronym summarizing the six dimensions evaluated when selecting stocks. A stock meeting multiple TIGERS criteria simultaneously presents the highest probability opportunity.

### T — Theme

**Definition**: The stock is riding a strong growth theme driven by larger forces.

**Judgment Criteria**:
- Two types: **Transformative** (new technology changing how we live — internet, smartphones, AI) and **Cyclical** (economic cycle-driven — energy, banks, construction)
- Transformative themes produce longer-lasting, more meaningful opportunities
- Multiple waves of innovation within a theme can create successive opportunities

**Three-Wave Alignment**: For a "special stock," three waves must align: (1) a healthy general market creating trends, (2) a disruptive theme attracting institutional accumulation, and (3) a specific company best positioned to profit. When all three waves combine, the result is a stock with maximum potential.

**Potential Leadership Groups (PLGs)**: Stocks move in groups. A few PLGs make up the current market cycle leadership. Even average stocks in strong groups can outperform the strongest stocks in mediocre groups. The goal is to identify the top 1-3 stocks within the current transformative theme of the cycle.

**Checklist**:
- Is this stock part of a current leading theme?
- Is the theme transformative or cyclical?
- Are multiple stocks in the group moving together (group move)?
- Is institutional accumulation visible across the theme?
- Are all three waves aligned (market + theme + company)?

### I — Innovation

**Definition**: The company has a standout product, service, or element that separates it from its peers.

**Judgment Criteria**:
- Look for proprietary technology, unique approaches to solving critical customer problems
- Assess what subject matter experts (not sensationalists) agree upon
- If possible, experience the product/service firsthand

**Checklist**:
- Does the company have a clear competitive advantage?
- Is the innovation leading to rapid market share growth?
- Is institutional behavior confirming the innovation thesis (price action must support it)?

### G — Growth

**Definition**: The company is currently growing earnings and sales rapidly, or is projected to in upcoming quarters.

**Judgment Criteria**:
- Minimum quarterly growth of 25% YoY in earnings or sales
- Triple-digit growth preferred
- **Acceleration** in growth is a powerful signal (e.g., 25% -> 40% -> 80% sequential quarters)
- Revenue growth is significant — many companies prioritize growth over immediate profit
- Sense that profits are on the near horizon, especially during tighter monetary cycles

**Checklist**:
- Is quarterly EPS growth >25% YoY?
- Is quarterly sales growth >25% YoY?
- Is the growth trend accelerating?
- Are there positive EPS/revenue surprises?
- Are forward estimates also strong (next quarter growth >30%)?

### E — Edges

**Definition**: The chart displays at least one of the recognized technical edges indicating institutional accumulation.

**Judgment Criteria**:
- Clear signs that the stock is in high demand by large players
- Trending in an orderly fashion during strong markets
- Fighting downtrends and bouncing quickly after corrections
- Gapping up on earnings, breaking out from base patterns

**Checklist**: See the Seven Winning Characteristics section for the foundational edge-detection checklist (increase in average volume, huge volume spikes, tight areas on low volume, MA respect, powerful prior moves, gap ups, relative strength). See `stock_identification.md` for detailed edge definitions (HVE, HVIPO, HV1, Increasing Average Volume, RS edge, N-Factor edge).

### R — Relative Strength

**Definition**: The stock is displaying unusual strength, outperformance, momentum, and trend.

**Judgment Criteria**:
- RS line in uptrend, ideally making new highs
- Near the top of three-month RS leaderboards
- Consistently trending above key moving averages
- Leading the market in the current cycle

**Checklist**: See `stock_identification.md` for RS edge detection criteria

### S — Setup

**Definition**: The stock is forming an actionable, studied setup pattern.

**Judgment Criteria**:
- Setup must offer a clearly defined entry level with a corresponding failure level
- Must allow tight and logical risk management
- Should be one of the trader's mastered setups

**Checklist**: See `stock_identification.md` for setup definitions (Launch Pad, Gapper, Base Breakout)

## Seven Winning Characteristics

Based on studies of top-performing stocks from the mid-1990s onwards, almost all stocks that double and triple share these seven price and volume characteristics. This checklist is the foundational edge-detection framework that feeds into the TIGERS Edges dimension and position sizing decisions.

1. **Increase in Average Volume** — A distinct step-up in average daily volume as institutions accumulate. Often begins at the start of a new uptrend or after a transformative earnings report. The stock is becoming more liquid and traded by more institutions.

2. **Huge Volume Spikes** — Highest volume in a year or more on the daily chart; large up-weeks on the weekly chart. Key moments include base breakouts and earnings reports. "Volume = Price, Cause = Effect."

3. **Tight Areas on Low Volume** — During trends and consolidation, the stock pauses and forms tight ranges with low volume — equilibrium in supply and demand, signifying lack of sellers and subtle institutional accumulation. The stock stair-steps: expand up, go tight, expand up, go tight, repeat.

4. **Respect for Moving Averages** — Strong leaders hold specific key MAs for extended periods. When that respect is lost, the move is near its end or the stock needs to build a longer base. Note which MA the stock respects (10-day, 21 EMA, 50 SMA, 10-week) — this is part of the stock's character.

5. **Powerful Prior Moves** — Winning stocks often continue to win. Stocks with strong recent trends can perform again after a base or corrective period. If the left side of the chart shows weak or choppy trading, do not expect a clean trend unless a full character change is visible.

6. **Gap Ups** — A key signature of market leaders. Stocks making 200-500%+ moves often have multiple gap ups during their advance. Early gaps in a move have higher probability of maturing into a sustained trend.

7. **Relative Strength** — Leaders stand out during corrections — going sideways or advancing while the market pulls in. Can be observed via the RS line or screened using RS rating and absolute strength ranking.

---

## Position Sizing Based on Edges

More edges present = more evidence of high potential = larger position allocation.

**Framework** (hypothetical 100k portfolio, 10% base position):

| Edges Present | Allocation | Amount |
|---|---|---|
| Base (0 edges) | 10% | 10k |
| 1 edge | 12.5% | 12.5k |
| 2 edges | 15% | 15k |
| 3 edges | 17.5% | 17.5k |
| 4 edges | 20% | 20k |

Adjust the base according to personal experience, skill level, and risk tolerance. Prioritize edges that are currently working in the market cycle — do not increase allocation based on an edge that is not performing in current conditions.

## The Four Stages of Trader Development

Every trader passes through four distinct stages. Progression requires brutal self-honesty, identified through the equity curve over time.

### Stage 1: Unprofitable Stage

**Equity Curve**: Volatile, downtrending.

**Characteristics**:
- Random entries and exits based on emotion and tips
- No system for buys/sells
- Trying multiple styles and instruments simultaneously
- No risk management (no stop losses, no position sizing)
- Driven entirely by search for quick money
- Oversized positions chasing doubles and triples

**Appropriate Risk Level**: Minimal real capital. Paper trading or very small positions.

**Progression Path**: Commit to learning. Write first set of trading rules. Build a consistent system for stock selection and entry setups. Implement stop losses. Adopt sell rules.

### Stage 2: Boom and Bust Stage

**Equity Curve**: Volatile, non-trending. Tracks with the market — up when the market is good, gives back when it turns.

**Characteristics**:
- More serious about trading, has read some books
- Better trade identification than Stage 1
- Still poor risk management
- Obsession with trying every indicator and strategy
- Lack of awareness of market cycles
- Profit-taking too early, over-trading

**Appropriate Risk Level**: Conservative sizing. Focus on learning over performance.

**Progression Path**: Focus on ONE time frame and ONE overall strategy. Study winning stocks and traders using the chosen strategy. Build rigid systems for entries, stops, position sizing, and selling. The transition from Stage 2 to Stage 3 generally occurs when traders limit noise and focus on mastering one strategy and even just one setup. This stage is the critical turning point — it feels frustrating, but Stage 3 is just a few tweaks away.

### Stage 3: Profitable and Consistent Stage

**Equity Curve**: Generally upward trending, forming higher lows from one market cycle to the next.

**Characteristics**:
- Fully committed to learning; read multiple trading books
- Found a sound strategy and follows the system nearly all the time
- Improved risk management skills
- Awareness of market trends and reacting accordingly
- Larger wins, smaller losses
- Good trade identification; cuts losing trades quickly; knows when to be in cash

**Appropriate Risk Level**: Normal position sizing per the edge-based framework. Begin to push sizing on highest-quality setups with tight entries.

**Progression Path**: Master a small handful of edges, setups, and entry tactics deeply. Trade in sync with medium-term market cycles. Double down on tight and logical entries. With tighter entries, position size higher while keeping risk in check. Focus on the highest potential stocks of each cycle.

### Stage 4: Performance Stage

**Equity Curve**: Sharp upward trend with higher lows. Distinguished from Stage 3 by the steepness during uptrends and the shallowness of drawdowns.

**Characteristics**:
- Mastery of trading system with continuous improvement
- Strong performance during opportunity periods, limited drawdowns
- Nailed-down daily routines keeping focus on highest-potential stocks
- Deep confidence in process and method, even with occasional setbacks
- Patient and selective when style is not suited for the environment
- "Wait, stalk, and pounce when the time is right"

**Appropriate Risk Level**: Full concentration on the best opportunities. Sizing aggressively into the highest quality setups at the correct moments of the cycle.

**Progression Path**: Fully master a small handful of entry setups and their nuances. Anticipate and trade in sync with shorter-term market cycles. Limit drawdowns as cycles end. Pursue capital, time, and performance efficiency.

### Equity Curve Diagnostic Method

Plot portfolio value on a time series chart (the equity curve), scanning out to at least one year. Each stage has a characteristic equity curve shape — volatile and downtrending (Stage 1), volatile and non-trending tracking the market (Stage 2), generally upward with higher lows (Stage 3), or steeply upward with shallow drawdowns (Stage 4). Use the equity curve as the primary self-assessment tool for identifying current stage.

**Timeline Benchmark**: Most top traders take approximately two full bull-to-bear market cycles to progress to Stage 3. Rushing this timeline typically results in regression.

## New Edge Discovery: The Meta-Methodology

### Trading Studies

A structured process for investigating market observations, testing hypotheses, and discovering actionable new edges.

**Step 1: Generate Ideas**
- Study setups or patterns to add to the arsenal
- Read trading books, listen to market wizards, analyze model book stocks
- Ask diagnostic questions: What is your weakness? What do past winners share? What commonly accepted truths might not hold? How would performance change with tweaked entry/exit rules?

**Step 2: Define the Study**
- Scope must be completable in approximately one month (expect it to take 2-3)
- Phrase as: "I will complete a trading study on ______ with the goal of ______. To do this I will ______ and then ______ to come up with my conclusion."
- Verify data access and feasibility
- Recruit collaborators when possible

**Step 3: Collect Examples and Data**
- Define exact data points needed (e.g., closing ranges, % off lows, volume vs. average, MA positions, subsequent performance at 5-day, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month intervals)
- Start with a few examples to identify blind spots in study design
- Collect from different time periods and market environments
- Track market environment as a data point for conditional analysis

**Step 4: Analyze Results**
- Organize data; verify completeness
- Write hypotheses based on observed patterns
- Create plots of characteristics vs. performance
- Group examples by similar data points or outcomes
- Analyze outliers — how are they different?
- Be open-minded — let the data guide, not preconceptions

**Step 5: Draw Conclusions**
- Organize findings in a document with key takeaways and relevant plots
- Include key statistics and conditional probabilities
- Address: most significant finding, hypothesis validation, market environment impact, surprising learnings, follow-up study ideas

### Model Book Construction

A model book is a compilation of the highest-quality, best-performing stocks over a particular period or cycle, with fundamental and technical data marked up with detailed notes.

**Purpose**: (1) Historical reference for future trades. (2) Deep understanding of what winning stocks look like across cycles.

**Six Steps**:
1. **Determine Scope**: Market cycle, year, setup type, or stock category (e.g., IPOs, Stage 2 Breakouts)
2. **Build Larger List**: Cast wide net — top-performing stocks of the period
3. **Finalize Smaller List**: Be extremely selective — best examples only. Consider earnings/sales acceleration, institutional sponsorship, the N-factor story
4. **Research Fundamental Drivers**: Business summary, group/sector performance, earnings/sales growth, fund sponsorship, catalysts
5. **Annotate Charts**: Highlight price/volume characteristics, potential entry/exit points, RS line behavior (especially RS new highs before price)
6. **Build the Book**: Organize fundamental and technical information into a reference document

**Key Insight**: The consolidation pivot entry — beginning positions at low-risk entry points up the right side of a promising stock's base, much earlier than waiting for a traditional base breakout. True market leaders almost always present another low-risk entry point, such as a pullback to a pivot or key moving average.

*Apply this framework independently to the current analysis target.*

## Screening Framework

### Screen Design Process

1. **Define Purpose**: Decide if the screen casts a wide net (general, 75-400 results) or looks for specific situations (specialist, <50 results)
2. **Identify Model Stock**: Choose a textbook example that the screen should surface
3. **Define Characteristics**: Break down both fundamental data points (EPS growth, sales growth, dollar volume) and technical data points (RS ratings, MA relationships, trend criteria)
4. **Create Prototype**: Build first iteration with chosen criteria
5. **Analyze Results**: Review output quality, check if model stocks appear, identify missing filters
6. **Update and Iterate**: Refine criteria and repeat until results are satisfactory

### Key Screening Data Points

**Fundamental**: Average dollar volume, EPS growth (latest reported and next quarter estimates), sales growth, EPS surprise, growth acceleration trend

**Technical**: Relative Strength ratings (1-week, 1-month, 3-month, 6-month, 12-month), price vs. 50-day/150-day/200-day SMA, % off 52-week high/low, Weinstein Stage, industry rank

**Intraday**: Volume run rate (20-day and 50-day), price % change (from previous close and from open), Daily Closing Range (DCR), price vs. VWAP

### Two Goals of Screening

1. **Consistently find high-quality and actionable trade ideas** — screens are a funnel, manual chart review is still the final step
2. **Gain a feel for the health and breadth of market action** — tracking result counts over time reveals market environment changes

See SKILL.md -> Screening, Technical

## Trading Routines

### Daily Routine Framework

**1 Hour Before Open**: Review premarket action. Finalize daily focus list (1-5 names). Set alerts on positions, market gauges, focus list stocks. Screen for premarket movers. Review existing positions for maintenance needs. Visualize scenarios and prepare game plans.

**Market Open**: Track price action of positions and top ideas. Sort watchlists by: high relative volume movers, high closing ranges, strong % movers, strong moves from open. Execute planned entries or sales. Monitor and reset alerts.

**During Market Hours**: Monitor price action and take notes. Research promising stocks and themes. Avoid micromanaging positions.

**1 Hour to Close**: Monitor closes of positions and top ideas. Note standout names. Be ready for end-of-day surges. Check profit cushion on new positions for overnight hold decisions.

**After Hours**: Complete daily trade journal. Monitor relevant earnings reports. Run daily screens and prepare next day's watchlist.

### Weekly Routine Framework

1. Analyze past week's actions — write down lessons and mistakes
2. Analyze general market indexes using market cycle rules
3. Go through universe screens — save ideas to watchlists, note developing themes
4. Refine watchlists — first pass yields ~75 stocks
5. Build weekly focus list — maximum ~15 most actionable names
6. Take time away from screens to reset

See SKILL.md -> Screening, Technical
