## RSI (Relative Strength Index)

### KOSPI Weekly RSI

| Level | Interpretation | Historical Evidence |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| 80 | Overbought entry (~once per 5 years) | Pivot from 80 = 100% probability of touching RSI 45 (25-year data) |
| 85 | Extreme overbought | Pivot from 85 = 100% probability of entering RSI 20s |
| 85 with drop of 5+ | Terminal signal | 100% probability of long-term decline phase |
| 87.04 | 99.8th percentile (Robust Z=2.76) | Only matched 2007-07-20 in 25 years |
| 49.4 | Average retracement target | Mean RSI level within 1 month after first break from 80 |

### KOSPI Daily RSI

| Level | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| 30 and below | Oversold zone entry (과매도 구간 진입) |

### Nasdaq RSI

| Level | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| 44-48 | Fear zone |
| 30 and below | Oversold / TQQQ entry consideration zone |

### Gold Monthly RSI

| Level | Interpretation | Historical Evidence |
|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| 87.1 | Historical #2 extreme | After 1979 Volcker appointment, before Lehman |
| 90+ | WWII-era extreme | Mean reversion return of -31% historically |

### Silver Monthly RSI

|-------|---------------|-------------------|
| 92-93 | Only comparable to 1970s oil shock | "70년대 오일쇼크가 아니면 시계열로 비교할 수 없는 통계" |

### RSI Derivative Signals

- **20MA slope touches 1.0 then declines**: 100% probability of turning negative (30-year data)
- **20-day RSI derivative double top**: Season ending signal -- consistent across 07-08, 17-18, 20-21
- **9-period EMA of RSI crossover**: Signal for reversal detection

## Z-Score / Sigma Levels

| Sigma | Probability | Interpretation | Comparable Event |
|-------|------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 2σ | ~5% | Notable anomaly, start monitoring | - |
| 3σ | 0.3% | Extreme event, high-conviction zone | "상위 0.3%의 잣대" |
| 4σ | 0.006% | Personal trading entry threshold | WTI going negative (COVID) |
| 4.2σ | ~0.001% | Extreme sentiment | "3200-3400 구간과는 비교가 안되는 극단 심리" |
| 5σ | 0.00003% | Market dysfunction | "331만 분의 1 상승장" |
| 6+σ | Incalculable | Off-the-charts | COVID WTI negative, Russian natural gas $10 |

### KOSPI Macro Model Z-Scores

| Z-Score | Interpretation |
|---------|---------------|
| -3.76σ | Overbought probability = 0.0084% (Jun 2025 peak) |
| -4.1σ | "80년대 이후 웬만한 버블은 명함도 못 내미는 수준"; top 0.0021% |
| -7.66 to -8σ | Comparable to Russian natural gas crisis (Jan 2026) |

---

## US10Y (US 10-Year Treasury Yield)

| Level | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| 3% range | Crash-level safe haven demand zone |
| 4.2-4.3% | Challenge zone / hard floor -- "전쟁 + 물가 하락이 겹쳐도 깨지 못한 4.3%대의 장벽" |
| 4.4% | Bounce ceiling in declining phase |
| 4.5% | Nominal fair value given rate cut pricing |
| 4.5-4.6% | Gravitational band -- "쉽사리 밴드를 내줄 생각이 없어 보입니다" |
| 4.6% | FED put trigger zone |
| 4.7-4.8% | Ceiling call zone (Q4 2024) |
| 5%+ | Proven: stocks cannot sustain without easing at this level |

### US10Y Valuation Implications

- US10Y at 4.4% implies PE of 22x (no duration) or 8x (with duration compound)
- At 4% mid-band, stocks need ~9% annual growth for 10 years to justify ERP

---

## CAPE (Shiller PE Ratio)

| Level | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| 28 and below | Definitively cheap zone ("싸다고 단정 지을 수 있는 구간") |
| 28-29 | Minimum "buyable" level; Biden dip 2022 summer was here |
| 29-32 | Not expensive for recent 8-year context |
| 32 | 2018-19 peak multiple -- comparison anchor |
| 36 | Matched exactly with October 1998 pre-dotcom |
| 37 | Repeated rejection level -- "CAPE 37대에서 번번히 reject" |
| 40-42 | Dot-com territory; implies ~4.7% annualized growth over 35 years priced in |
| 30+ zone crash frequency | Every 1 year 11 months on average (recent 6 years) |

---

## Yield Curve Spreads

### KR 10Y-2Y Spread

| Level | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| 10bp | Comparable periods: 2018/2023 |
| 46bp | Current elevated level -- massively above historical norms |
| 50bp | Bear steepening danger zone -- "변동성 주의 시그널" |
| 60bp | Genuine economic confidence ("경기 자신감") |

### US-KR 10Y Spread

| Level | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| ~50bp (historical mean) | Normal spread |
| 180-200bp | Current level; effectively wider due to BOK RP suppression |

### Special Yield Curve Pattern

US10Y-2Y positive + US10Y-3M negative simultaneously: Only observed in Sep-Oct 1998 in 30 years -- highly anomalous.

---

## USD/KRW (Won-Dollar)

| Level | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| 1385원 | GBM model fair value |
| 1400원 | New normal base view -- "1400원 뉴노멀 뷰를 유지합니다" |
| 1410원 | Dollar leverage long entry |
| 1430원 | DXY coupling zone -- "1430원부터는 DXY와 원화는 커플링구간" |
| 1480원 | Short dollar position ceiling target |
| 1500원 | Upside potential if BOK loses control |

### USDKRW-DXY Correlation

- 0.7: 20-year average R exceeded; once at this level, if US rates rise, USDKRW goes back to 1500
- Z-score below -3σ: Current KRW strength is at extreme

### Critical Regime Change

1400원 active breakout: Pattern similarity shifts from 17/02 (-23% correction) to 07/22 (-44% crash patterns). "환율이 튀면 조정 -> 버블"

| 84.06 | 12-year low, statistically extreme skew |
| 30% return spike | 2011-05-05 pattern: silver crashed, KOSPI peaked within 3 days |

---

## HY (High Yield) Spread

| Level | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| 2% range | Only level where US equities at current valuation can breathe |
| 3%+ | Even COVID phase hit 3% HY yield |
| 4% area | 22-23 average zone |
| 4.6% | Peak of tariff phase |

---

## BDI (Baltic Dry Index)

| Level | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| Under 700 | Historical low -- only COVID and China bubble periods were lower |
| Under 1000 | Major recession zone |
| 1200 range | Bottom formed pre-tariff due to front-loading |
| 1450-1650 | Recovery/expansion zone boundary |
| -50% crash (e.g., 3000 to 1500) | NOT seasonal adjustment -- genuine demand destruction |

## Trading Pattern Statistics (KOSPI)

| Pattern | History | Probability |
|---------|---------|------------|
| Daily +7% or more in uptrend | 30 years, 13 occurrences | Only 1 case in uptrend: March 2, 2000 (dot-com peak) |
| -5% then +5% in uptrend | 30 years, 7 occurrences | Only 1 case in uptrend: June 10-11, 1999 (retested lows within 3 days) |
| BB lower band -> bounce -> 20MA reject at ATH | 25 years, 11 occurrences | 80% crashed through prior low within 1 month |
| Institutional 4σ buy | Historical | 77.8% hit ratio, +3.9% avg 20-day return |
| Foreign 4σ buy | Historical | 50% hit ratio, -0.8% avg 20-day return (contrarian) |

## TGA, RRP & Liquidity Plumbing

### TGA (Treasury General Account)

| Level | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| $50B or below | Depletion zone: Treasury must issue bills -> liquidity injection into system |
| $200-400B | Normal operating range |
| $500B+ | Accumulation phase: liquidity drain from system (post-debt-ceiling refill) |
| $700B+ (refill after ceiling) | Aggressive drain; combined with QT = double tightening |

**Mechanism**: TGA drawdown = net liquidity injection (Treasury spends from account). TGA refill = net liquidity drain (Treasury issues bonds, pulls cash from system). "TGA 고갈 + 추가 발행 압력 + 금리 위기 = Fed pivot 강제"

**Script**: `data_advanced/fred tga --series-type weekly_avg --limit 52` for weekly TGA balance

### RRP (Reverse Repo Facility)

| Level | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| Near 0 | Fully drained; no more liquidity buffer; market vulnerable to shocks |
| $100-300B | Low buffer zone |
| $500B | Moderate cushion |
| $1T+ | Excess liquidity parked at Fed; potential for release into system |
| $2T+ (2022 peak) | Extreme excess; unwinding = massive liquidity injection |

**Mechanism**: RRP decline = money market funds moving cash into T-bills or bank deposits. When RRP is exhausted, QT directly drains bank reserves. "RRP가 바닥나면 QT의 충격이 은행 지급준비금을 직접 타격"

**Script**: `data_advanced/fred policy --indicator reverse_repo --limit 52` for RRP balance

### Fed Balance Sheet / QT

| Level | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| $6.7T range (2026) | Post-QT normalization zone |
| $7.5T | Pre-QT peak reference (2022) |
| $8.9T | All-time peak (Apr 2022) |
| QT pace $60B/mo+ | Aggressive tightening |
| QT pace $25B/mo | Reduced pace (current) |
| QT pause/end | Liquidity relief signal |

**Key Framework**: TGA + RRP + Reserve Balances = Net Liquidity. When net liquidity declines while equity multiples are elevated, the market is on "산소호흡기" (life support). Track the combined trajectory, not individual components.

**Script**: `data_advanced/fred policy --indicator fed_balance_sheet --limit 52` for balance sheet

### Reserve Balances

| Level | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| $3.0T and below | Stress zone: bank reserves insufficient for smooth market functioning |
| $3.0-3.5T | Adequate but declining (current range) |
| $4.0T+ | Comfortable |

---

## S&P 500 / US Equity Specific

### S&P 500 Macro Model Residual Z-Score

| Z-Score | Interpretation |
|---------|---------------|
| +2sigma | Overvalued vs macro factors; caution |
| +3sigma | Extreme overvaluation; high-conviction short zone begins |
| +4sigma | Off-the-charts; comparable to macro model Z for KOSPI at -3.76sigma |
| -2sigma | Undervalued vs macro factors; buying zone entry |
| -3sigma | Extreme undervaluation; high-conviction long |

**Script**: `macro/macro.py residual SPY --inputs DX-Y.NYB,GC=F,^TNX --period 10y`

### ERP (Equity Risk Premium) vs US10Y

| Level | Interpretation |
|-------|---------------|
| ERP < 0 (negative) | Stocks offer LESS than bonds; extreme danger; only justified during bubble |
| ERP 0-1% | Very thin margin; vulnerable to any rate spike |
| ERP 2-3% | Normal; stocks modestly compensate for risk |
| ERP 4%+ | Cheap; strong buy signal if not recession |

**Formula**: ERP = (1/CAPE) - US10Y. At CAPE 40 and US10Y 4.5%: ERP = 2.5% - 4.5% = -2.0% (negative!)

## FX Reserve Structural Weakness (Korea)

- Foreign reserves rank: 9th globally
- Gold holdings rank: 41st
- Gold-to-reserves ratio rank: 98th
- Implication: "남들 버리는 달러 겨우 모아서 외환보유고를 늘려도 미국 M2에 비하면 새 발의 피 수준"
