# SidneyKim0 Historical Analogy Catalog

## Overview

SidneyKim0 uses historical analogies NOT as predictions but as statistical anchors. Each analogy has specific "necessary conditions" (필요조건) that must be met. If conditions are violated, the analogy is rejected regardless of surface-level pattern similarity.

## 2011 Post-GFC Sheep Shearing -- Base Case for 2026

### Conditions

- EM massively outperforming DM
- Record precious metals rally
- Long-term rates pivoting upward in Q4
- Cross-margin / risk parity mechanics forcing deleveraging

### Key Dates

- **2011-05-05**: Silver crashed (gold/silver ratio 30% spike)
- **2011-05-02**: KOSPI peaked (6 years 2 months to recover)
- Within 3 days of each other

### Sequence

1. All asset classes caught up to US equities post-Lehman
2. Non-ferrous metals (silver) crashed first
3. EM crashed harder than DM
4. US absorbed global liquidity ("양털깎기")
5. KOSPI boxed for 6.2 years while NASDAQ rose 125%

### Outcome

"EM이 잘 될수록 -> 달러는 미국 밖으로 빠지게 되고 + 달러 발행비용은 높아지기에 필연적으로 미국은 이 상황을 되돌리려 합니다"

### Trading Strategy

Short weakest narrative assets first -> Wait for crisis -> Switch to long NASDAQ at tipping point. "코스피 숏 + 나스닥 롱 전략"

### SidneyKim0's Target

- KOSPI short TP: 4680-4700 area (daily RSI 30s, ~10% decline from peak)
- Then watch if AI narrative breaks

## 2007 Pre-Lehman -- Most Referenced Analogy

### Conditions

- EM >>> US equities: KOSPI +59.75% vs NASDAQ +15% in 2006-07
- Gold rising with equities
- Oil lagging
- Yield spreads not widening despite equity rally
- Currency not strengthening despite EM equity explosion
- CAPE levels elevated

### Statistical Match

KOSPI weekly RSI 87.04 on 2007-07-20 = statistical match to Nov 2025 (only occurrence in 25 years at same level)

### Sequence

1. Gold kept building position while equities recovered from dip
2. Oil couldn't follow
3. Bond spreads stayed compressed
4. EM peaked
5. Crisis unfolded
6. 3 consecutive rate cuts (Sep-Oct-Dec 2007) preceded Lehman collapse

### Outcome

Lehman crisis -> Global financial meltdown -> EM devastated

## 1998 Pre-Dotcom (1 Year Before Bubble Peak)

### Conditions

- Yield curve pattern: US10Y-2Y positive + US10Y-3M negative (only time besides now in 30 years)
- CAPE at 36 (exact match)
- S&P 500 dividend yield at ~1.28% (exact match)
- Fed funds rate above 5% for years, yet equity multiples exploded
- First time people asked "이거 버블아냐?" (isn't this a bubble?)
- CPI ~3%, unemployment ~4%

### What Happened Next

- Fed cut rates by 100bp+ rapidly
- NASDAQ dropped -33%, then rallied +200% before the actual bubble burst

### Key Differences from Now

- GDP-to-debt ratio is now 2.3x higher
- TGA account constraints prevent active fiscal policy
- Trump tariffs prevent active rate cuts
- China is the adversary (unlike 1998)

---

## 2001 Dot-Com Collapse

### Conditions

- Bubble multiples (CAPE extreme)
- CPI ~3%, unemployment ~4%
- 3 consecutive rate cuts (Jan-Mar-May)

### Outcome

"버블(멀티플)이 무너지며 기습적인 침체" -- Multiples collapsed triggering surprise recession.

### Lesson

Rate cuts alone cannot prevent collapse when the bubble is in multiples, not fundamentals.

## 2018-2019 Trump Trade War

### Conditions

- Trump threatening tariffs and refusing to back down
- NASDAQ dropped -23% over 12 weeks
- CAPE around 28-32
- Fed funds rate was ~200bp lower than current

### Resolution

- Dec 2018 panic -> PPT mention -> Jan 2019 FOMC Powell pivot -> market bottomed
- Insurance rate cuts ("보험적 금리인하") + Trump detente
- NASDAQ +33% within 3 months of bottom

### Key Differences from Now (Why It May Not Repeat)

- Fed funds rate was 200bp+ lower
- S&P 500 average dividend yield was 60bp higher
- Fed balance sheet was healthy enough for QT reduction
- No yield curve inversion at the pivot point
- Gold rally was not this fast
- CAPE peak was only 32 (vs 36+ now)
- "지금은 '스치면 치명상' 인 phase" (now, even a graze is fatal)

---

## 2019 Insurance Cuts (Mildest Scenario)

### Conditions

- 300 days without new highs (range-bound)
- CPI ~1%, unemployment ~3.7%
- 3 consecutive cuts (Jul-Sep-Oct)

### Outcome

Low inflation + sufficient consolidation built foundation for insurance cuts -- mildest scenario possible.

### Requirement for This to Repeat

"NASDAQ YoY negative" was required historically for 3 consecutive rate cuts.

### Conditions

- Safe haven demand concentrated exclusively in US Treasuries (not gold, not BTC)
