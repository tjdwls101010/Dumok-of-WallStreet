# SidneyKim0 Cross-Asset Analysis Framework

## Overview

Cross-asset relationships form the empirical backbone of macro regime identification. No single asset tells the complete story — the pattern of relationships between assets reveals the underlying regime and flags transitions before they are visible in any single price series.

## The Core Triangle: Rates — Dollar — Risk Assets

The most fundamental cross-asset relationship is the interaction among US interest rates, the US dollar, and risk assets (equities, credit, EM).

### Normal Relationships
| Condition | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|------------------|
| Rates rise (growth-driven) | USD neutral/weak; equities stable/up |
| Rates rise (inflation-driven) | USD strong; equities down |
| Rates fall (Fed cutting) | USD weak; equities up; EM rally |
| USD strengthens | EM equities down; commodities pressured |
| USD weakens | EM equities rally; commodities up |

### Anomaly Signals (Regime Transition Indicators)
When the normal relationships break down, a regime transition is likely underway:

- **Gold rising AND USD rising simultaneously**: Safe-haven stress, not normal risk-on. Indicates capital seeking safety in multiple reserve assets simultaneously. Historical precursor to broader risk-off.
- **Equities up AND credit spreads widening**: Equity rally is not confirmed by credit; typically precedes equity reversal.
- **EM rallying strongly while DM rates rise**: EM is burning future returns forward. Historically precedes sharp EM correction once the yield differential becomes unsustainable.
- **"장기금리 상승 & 원화 하락을 시장 호재로 인식하다 악재로 바뀐 것"**: The regime flip moment — when rate rise stops being "good news" and becomes "bad news."

## US Yield Curve Analysis

### Curve Shapes and Market Implications

**Bear Steepening** (long rates rise faster than short rates):
- Drivers: Inflation expectations, term premium expansion, fiscal risk
- Equity impact: Negative for long-duration equities (tech, growth); positive for financials
- Macro signal: Market pricing in inflation risk or fiscal sustainability concern
- EM impact: Significant negative — EM funding costs rise, USD strengthens

**Bull Steepening** (short rates fall faster than long rates):
- Drivers: Fed cutting, recession fears with long rates anchored by flight to quality
- Equity impact: Initially negative (recession fear), then positive as easing takes hold
- EM impact: Positive medium-term if driven by Fed pivot

**Bear Flattening** (short rates rise faster than long rates):
- Drivers: Early Fed tightening cycle
- Equity impact: Mixed — value outperforms growth
- Historical: 2022 early phase

**Inversion** (short > long):
- Historical recession precursor with 12-18 month lead time
- Most reliable signal for late-cycle positioning

**Partial Inversion Anomaly** (US10Y-2Y positive, US10Y-3M negative):
- Occurred in September-October 1998 and March 2025
- 1998 context: Preceded the final phase of dotcom bubble expansion (+200% from -33% drawdown)
- Signal: Short-end pricing cuts while long-end resists — market expecting Fed rescue

### Key Spread Metrics to Track Daily
- **US10Y-2Y** (10Y2Y): Primary curve shape indicator
- **US10Y-3M** (10Y3M): Short-end policy expectation
- **US10Y absolute level**: ERP and valuation anchor
- **Cross-country spreads**: US10Y vs. JPY 10Y, KR 10Y, EUR 10Y — liquidity flow signals

### Bear Steepening Significance
Bear steepening is the most dangerous regime for EM and growth equities:
- "베어 스티프닝" = bear steepening = both rates rising with long rates faster
- When the 10Y-2Y spread widens while both rates rise: fiscal sustainability is being questioned
- Combined with USD strength: global liquidity flows to US (양털깎기 cycle begins)

## Dollar Index (DXY) Analysis

### Role in the Macro Framework

DXY is the global liquidity transmission mechanism. Dollar strength is not just a US story — it determines global credit conditions, EM debt serviceability, and commodity price dynamics.

### DXY Trend Interpretation
| DXY Trend | Global Implication |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Rising (strong USD) | Global dollar liquidity tightening; EM stress |
| Falling (weak USD) | Global liquidity easing; EM and commodity rally |
| Rising while US rates falling | Safe-haven demand (flight to quality) |
| Falling while US rates rising | EM driven by carry trade unwinding |

### USD-EM Relationship (Yield Differential Framework)
The key mechanism: yield spread between US and EM determines capital flow direction.

- When US yield > EM yield: Capital flows to US (both for return AND safety)
- When US yield < EM yield: Carry trade into EM temporarily
- "미국 금리가 더 높으면 미국 안전자산으로, 더 낮으면 미국 주식으로" — in both scenarios, capital gravitates toward the US

The divergence phase (EM outperforms despite US yield advantage) eventually resolves violently toward the historical norm.

## Gold Analysis

### Gold's Dual Role
Gold is simultaneously a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge. Its behavior relative to the dollar reveals which role dominates.

**Gold as Safe Haven** (risk-off regime):
- Gold rises while equities fall
- Gold rises while commodities fall
- Gold rises and dollar ALSO rises (dual safe-haven demand)
- Post-2011 analog: "금을 제외한 비철들이 폭락하며, 금은 다시 safe haven으로 전환"

**Gold as Risk Asset** (risk-on regime):
- Gold rises with equities and commodities
- Gold rises while dollar weakens
- This is the "everything rally" pattern

**Gold Signal Priority**:
1. When gold decouples from its historical drivers (should fall with dollar but doesn't), investigate why
2. When gold makes new highs while silver and other precious metals stagnate, it's pure safe-haven bid
3. "위험자산-금의 디커플링" = risk asset vs. gold decoupling = regime transition signal

### Historical Gold-Liquidity Cycle Pattern
From the 2011 analog:
1. Global everything rally: Gold, EM equities, commodities all rally together
2. Gold peaks first and holds (transitions to safe-haven)
3. Non-gold commodities collapse (BDI, metals)
4. EM equities collapse
5. Gold remains elevated while risk assets correct
6. Eventually US absorbs all global liquidity; gold normalizes
7. "1년 동안 원자재 중 고점을 유지하는 것은 오로지 금뿐"

## Liquidity Framework: TGA, RRP, Fed Balance Sheet

### Net Liquidity Formula
```
Fed Net Liquidity = Fed Balance Sheet − Treasury General Account (TGA) − Reverse Repo (RRP)
```

### Components
**Fed Balance Sheet**: Total assets (Treasuries + MBS + lending facilities). Growing = QE; shrinking = QT.

**TGA (Treasury General Account)**: US Treasury cash balance at the Fed. When TGA declines, cash flows into the banking system (liquidity positive). When TGA increases (Treasury issuing debt), liquidity is drained.

**RRP (Reverse Repo Facility)**: Overnight lending to money market funds. High RRP = excess liquidity parked at the Fed, not circulating. Declining RRP = liquidity re-entering the system.

### Interpretation
| Net Liquidity Change | Market Implication |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Rising (QE + TGA drain + RRP decline) | Liquidity expanding; risk assets positive |
| Falling (QT + TGA build + RRP rising) | Liquidity contracting; risk assets negative |
| QT ongoing but RRP declining | Liquidity neutral (RRP acts as buffer) |
| TGA rapidly declining near debt ceiling | Short-term liquidity surge — temporary tailwind |

## Credit Spread Analysis

### High-Yield Spread as Risk Barometer
Credit spreads (HY spread over Treasuries) are a leading indicator for equity risk:
- Spreads widening while equities hold = warning signal; credit sees stress before equity
- Spreads tightening while equities flat = potential catch-up rally incoming
- "HY 섹터의 주춤" = HY underperformance = early 역금융장세 signal

### Key Observation Points
- HY vs. IG spread differential: When HY underperforms IG disproportionately, credit market is pricing systemic risk
- Investment-grade credit as equity hedge: IG bonds and equities tend to be more correlated than HY and equities
- Put/Call ratio below 0.6 combined with HY spread widening = extreme sentiment divergence (credit more cautious than equity options market)

## Commodity-Macro Connection

### Baltic Dry Index (BDI)
BDI tracks real shipping rates for bulk dry goods — a real-time proxy for global trade volume.

- **BDI falling sharply** (600+ point drop): Real global trade demand weakening; macro slowdown signal before it appears in official data
- **BDI rising while manufacturing PMIs fall**: Transport demand driven by front-loading (e.g., tariff-front-running), not genuine demand recovery — false positive signal

### Commodity Price Indices
- **GSCI +3% MoM**: Broad commodity inflation signal
- **LME index +2% MoM**: Industrial metals — growth expectations embedded in prices
- **CRB index +1.5% MoM**: Composite commodity inflation
- These indices moving up simultaneously with DXY weakening = classic "everything rally" risk-on signal

### Semiconductor Spot Prices
DRAM and NAND spot prices function as a real-time semiconductor demand tracker:
- **Spot prices making new highs**: Demand exceeding supply; semiconductor cycle healthy
- **Spot prices peaking and turning**: Leading indicator for revenue trajectory of semiconductor companies
- Context matters: HBM-driven strength masks weakness in legacy DRAM spot prices

## Cross-Asset Divergence / Convergence Detection

### Divergence Framework
A divergence occurs when assets that should move together (based on historical correlation) begin moving in opposite directions.

**High-Alpha Divergences**:
1. **Risk assets rally while credit spreads widen**: Equity running ahead of credit
2. **EM outperforms while US yield advantage widening**: EM borrowing from future returns
3. **Gold rises while dollar also rises**: Dual safe-haven demand — flight from the system
4. **Nasdaq rallies while semiconductors underperform**: Sector leadership breakdown within tech

### Convergence Framework
When divergent assets eventually reconnect with their historical relationship, the correction is often sharp.

"이격 해소" (gap resolution) = the convergence process. Track:
- The size of the divergence in standard deviation terms
- The historical average time for resolution
- Which direction the resolution typically occurs (does the laggard catch up, or does the leader fall back?)

## Sector Rotation Signals

### Macro-Driven Sector Rotation Map

| Macro Regime | Outperforming Sectors | Underperforming Sectors |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 실적장세 | Tech, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials | Utilities, Staples |
| 역금융장세 | Energy, Materials, Financials | Tech, Growth, Duration |
| 역실적장세 | Utilities, Staples, Healthcare | Everything cyclical |
| 유동성 쏠림 | US large-cap quality | EM equities, HY bonds, Speculative commodities |

### Materials Sector as Macro Signal
Materials sector PE relative to its own 10-year historical average is a commodity expectations barometer:

- **PE near or below historical mean**: Commodity market not yet pricing an inflationary cycle; potential early entry
- **PE 1-2σ above historical mean**: Commodity expectations beginning to be priced into equities; monitor, not alarm
- **PE 2σ+ above historical mean**: Forward commodity prices already embedded in multiples; late-cycle commodity positioning signal
- **PE 3σ+ above historical mean**: Extreme; commodity bull case is fully priced. This is a sell signal for Materials, not a buy signal — the market has already priced the thesis

**Methodology rule**: Track Materials PE Z-score vs. 10-year mean. When it reaches the 2σ+ zone, shift from accumulating commodity exposure to monitoring for rotation signals. At 3σ+, assume the commodity tailwind is already discounted and position accordingly.
