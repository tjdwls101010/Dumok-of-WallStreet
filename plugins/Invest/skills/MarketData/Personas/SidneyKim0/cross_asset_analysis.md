# SidneyKim0 Cross-Asset Analysis Framework

## Overview

Cross-asset relationships form the empirical backbone of macro regime identification. No single asset tells the complete story — the pattern of relationships between assets reveals the underlying regime and flags transitions before they are visible in any single price series.

## The Core Triangle: Rates — Dollar — Risk Assets

The most fundamental cross-asset relationship is the interaction among US interest rates, the US dollar, and risk assets (equities, credit, EM).

### Normal Relationships
| Condition | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|------------------|
| Rates rise (growth-driven) | USD neutral/weak; equities stable/up |
| Rates rise (inflation-driven) | USD strong; equities down |
| Rates fall (Fed cutting) | USD weak; equities up; EM rally |
| USD strengthens | EM equities down; commodities pressured |
| USD weakens | EM equities rally; commodities up |

### Anomaly Signals (Regime Transition Indicators)
When the normal relationships break down, a regime transition is likely underway:

- **Gold rising AND USD rising simultaneously**: Safe-haven stress, not normal risk-on. Indicates capital seeking safety in multiple reserve assets simultaneously. Historical precursor to broader risk-off.
- **Equities up AND credit spreads widening**: Equity rally is not confirmed by credit; typically precedes equity reversal.
- **EM rallying strongly while DM rates rise**: EM is burning future returns forward. Historically precedes sharp EM correction once the yield differential becomes unsustainable.
- **Rate-Index Divergence**: When US10Y rises significantly (15+ BP) but equities close flat/mild negative while HY sectors (SOX, Nasdaq) continue rising — the bond market is pricing risk that equities haven't yet reflected. Leading bearish signal.
- **Rate-Dollar Decoupling**: When US10Y rises 15+ BP but DXY falls simultaneously — sovereign credibility signal. Yield rise is driven by risk premium (term premium), not growth. Different implications than a normal rate rise: weaker for risk assets, but dollar weakness may NOT support EM equities in the usual sense.
- **T-Bond credibility break**: T-bonds dumped + gold surging + dollar surging simultaneously = the market is questioning US sovereign credit. This triple signal has historically preceded major risk-off events.

## US Yield Curve Analysis

### Curve Shapes and Market Implications

**Bear Steepening** (long rates rise faster than short rates):
- Drivers: Inflation expectations, term premium expansion, fiscal risk
- Equity impact: Negative for long-duration equities (tech, growth); positive for financials
- Macro signal: Market pricing in inflation risk or fiscal sustainability concern
- EM impact: Significant negative — EM funding costs rise, USD strengthens
- Combined with USD strength: global liquidity flows to US (양털깎기 cycle begins)

**Bull Steepening** (short rates fall faster than long rates):
- Drivers: Fed cutting, recession fears with long rates anchored by flight to quality
- Equity impact: Initially negative (recession fear), then positive as easing takes hold
- EM impact: Positive medium-term if driven by Fed pivot

**Bear Flattening** (short rates rise faster than long rates):
- Drivers: Early Fed tightening cycle
- Equity impact: Mixed — value outperforms growth
- Historical: 2022 early phase

**Inversion** (short > long):
- Historical recession precursor with 12-18 month lead time
- Most reliable signal for late-cycle positioning

**Partial Inversion Anomaly** (US10Y-2Y positive, US10Y-3M negative):
- Occurred in September-October 1998 and March 2025
- 1998 context: Preceded the final phase of dotcom bubble expansion (+200% from -33% drawdown)
- Signal: Short-end pricing cuts while long-end resists — market expecting Fed rescue

### Key Spread Metrics
- **US10Y-2Y** (10Y2Y): Primary curve shape indicator
- **US10Y-3M** (10Y3M): Short-end policy expectation; persistent inversion more reliable recession predictor than 10Y2Y
- **US10Y absolute level**: ERP and valuation anchor
- **Cross-country spreads**: US10Y vs. JPY 10Y, EUR 10Y — liquidity flow signals

### Rate High-Plateau Regime
When rates stabilize at a high level (e.g., US10Y 4.3-4.7%) without crisis, equities can rally on the *stability* of rates even though the *level* is headwind. This "high-plateau" regime is equity-supportive in the short-term but ultimately terminal — the high rate level compresses ERP over time and eventually triggers the correction. The duration of the plateau determines whether it's a 1993-style slow grind or a 2007-style sudden break.

## Dollar Index (DXY) Analysis

### Role in the Macro Framework

DXY is the global liquidity transmission mechanism. Dollar strength is not just a US story — it determines global credit conditions, EM debt serviceability, and commodity price dynamics.

### DXY Trend Interpretation
| DXY Trend | Global Implication |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Rising (strong USD) | Global dollar liquidity tightening; EM stress |
| Falling (weak USD) | Global liquidity easing; EM and commodity rally |
| Rising while US rates falling | Safe-haven demand (flight to quality) |
| Falling while US rates rising | Sovereign credibility issue (risk premium rising) |

### DXY Level Thresholds
- **DXY 99-100**: EM trigger level. Below this, safe-haven easing confirmed; EM rally has room. Above this, dollar strength constrains EM and commodities.
- **DXY structural ceiling**: When DXY is strong but rate differentials suggest it should weaken, the ceiling is formed by macro contradiction — the dollar cannot sustain strength against its own fundamental headwinds. Identify this ceiling via the DXY-10Y spread divergence signal.

### USD-EM Relationship (Yield Differential Framework)
The key mechanism: yield spread between US and EM determines capital flow direction.

- When US yield > EM yield: Capital flows to US (both for return AND safety)
- When US yield < EM yield: Carry trade into EM temporarily
- The divergence phase (EM outperforms despite US yield advantage) eventually resolves violently toward the historical norm

### Strong Dollar + Strong Oil Regime
When both DXY and WTI are rising simultaneously, this is an inflationary regime signal — the dollar is rising for safe-haven reasons while oil is rising for supply/demand reasons. This combination is maximally negative for EM and growth equities because both input costs (energy) and funding costs (dollar) are rising.

## Gold Analysis

### Gold's Dual Role
Gold is simultaneously a safe-haven asset and an inflation hedge. Its behavior relative to the dollar reveals which role dominates.

**Gold as Safe Haven** (risk-off regime):
- Gold rises while equities fall
- Gold rises while commodities fall
- Gold rises and dollar ALSO rises (dual safe-haven demand)

**Gold as Risk Asset** (risk-on regime):
- Gold rises with equities and commodities
- Gold rises while dollar weakens
- This is the "everything rally" pattern

### Gold Signal Priority
1. When gold decouples from its historical drivers (should fall with dollar but doesn't), investigate why
2. When gold makes new highs while silver and other precious metals stagnate, it's pure safe-haven bid
3. Gold monthly RSI reaching 90+: historically a cycle-top signal across multiple asset classes. Post-gold-RSI-90 forward returns are historically negative over 3-6 months.

### Gold/Silver Ratio Framework
The Gold/Silver ratio (XAU/XAG) is one of the most powerful risk-off leading indicators:

- **Ratio surging 30%+ in short period**: Broad deleveraging underway; equities next to fall
- **Ratio at historical extremes**: Silver short has positive expectancy
- **After extreme spike**: If Gold holds while Silver rebounds → equities tend to bounce. If Gold itself declines after the spike → deeper crash follows.
- The ratio has reached historical extremes at the onset of: 2011 EM peak, COVID crash, Lehman 2008

### Gold-Nasdaq Simultaneous Rise
When Gold and Nasdaq both rise to new highs simultaneously, this is an unstable configuration — one is a risk-on asset, the other risk-off. Historically:
- If Gold continues rising while Nasdaq reverses → risk-off wins
- If Nasdaq holds while Gold corrects → risk-on continues
- The divergence resolution provides a high-alpha signal

### Gold vs. Bond Performance Gap
When Gold dramatically outperforms Treasuries as a safe haven, it signals the market doubts sovereign bond safety. This is a qualitatively different signal than normal risk-off (where both gold and bonds rally). Track the Gold/TLT ratio for this signal.

### Historical Gold-Liquidity Cycle Pattern
From the 2011 analog:
1. Global everything rally: Gold, EM equities, commodities all rally together
2. Gold peaks first and holds (transitions to safe-haven)
3. Non-gold commodities collapse (BDI, metals)
4. EM equities collapse
5. Gold remains elevated while risk assets correct
6. Eventually US absorbs all global liquidity; gold normalizes

## Liquidity Framework: TGA, RRP, Fed Balance Sheet

### Net Liquidity Formula
```
Fed Net Liquidity = Fed Balance Sheet − Treasury General Account (TGA) − Reverse Repo (RRP)
```

### Components
**Fed Balance Sheet**: Total assets. Growing = QE; shrinking = QT.

**TGA (Treasury General Account)**: US Treasury cash balance at the Fed. When TGA declines, cash flows into the banking system (liquidity positive). When TGA increases, liquidity is drained.

**RRP (Reverse Repo Facility)**: High RRP = excess liquidity parked at the Fed. Declining RRP = liquidity re-entering the system. RRP at floor level means the liquidity buffer is exhausted — further QT directly drains bank reserves.

**Reserve Balance (지준금)**: Bank reserves held at the Fed. When reserves fall below a threshold, interbank stress begins. Track reserve balance as a gauge of whether QT is still safe or approaching breaking point.

### Interpretation
| Net Liquidity Change | Market Implication |
|---------------------|------------------|
| Rising (QE + TGA drain + RRP decline) | Liquidity expanding; risk assets positive |
| Falling (QT + TGA build + RRP rising) | Liquidity contracting; risk assets negative |
| QT ongoing but RRP declining | Liquidity neutral (RRP acts as buffer) |
| TGA rapidly declining near debt ceiling | Short-term liquidity surge — temporary tailwind |
| RRP near zero + QT continuing | Dangerous — reserves draining directly; watch for interbank stress |

### QT Completeness Test
Monitor whether QT is still "safe" by checking:
1. RRP level — while RRP is declining, QT is draining excess reserves (safe)
2. Reserve balance — when reserves approach the estimated "ample" threshold, QT stress begins
3. Fed balance sheet trajectory vs. pre-announced plan — deviations signal stress awareness

## Credit Spread Analysis

### High-Yield Spread as Risk Barometer
Credit spreads (HY spread over Treasuries) are a leading indicator for equity risk:
- Spreads widening while equities hold = warning signal; credit sees stress before equity
- Spreads tightening while equities flat = potential catch-up rally incoming

### Key Observations
- HY vs. IG spread differential: When HY underperforms IG disproportionately, credit market is pricing systemic risk
- Put/Call ratio below 0.6 combined with HY spread widening = extreme sentiment divergence (credit more cautious than equity options market)
- **HY spread + safe-haven simultaneous elevation**: When both HY spreads and safe-haven demand (gold, long bonds) are elevated simultaneously, this is a structural warning — the market is both reaching for yield and hedging against collapse. Historically precedes sharp correction.
- **Private credit NAV-price divergence**: When private credit vehicles (BDC ETFs, CLO funds) trade at significant discounts to NAV while HY spreads are still tight, the private market is pricing risk that the public market hasn't acknowledged. Leading indicator.

## Commodity-Macro Connection

### Baltic Dry Index (BDI)
BDI tracks real shipping rates for bulk dry goods — a real-time proxy for global trade volume.

- **BDI falling sharply** (600+ point drop): Real global trade demand weakening; macro slowdown signal before it appears in official data
- **BDI rising while manufacturing PMIs fall**: Transport demand driven by front-loading (e.g., tariff-front-running), not genuine demand recovery — false positive signal

### WTI Backwardation/Contango as Cycle Indicator
- **WTI in backwardation** (near-term > deferred): Physical demand exceeds supply; economic activity strong. Bullish for energy equities.
- **WTI shifting to contango** (deferred > near-term): Physical demand weakening; storage building. Bearish for energy, and a leading indicator for broader economic slowdown.
- The shift from backwardation to contango is a cycle-turning indicator for the real economy.

### DXY-Adjusted Commodity Price Signal
Raw commodity price changes are misleading without DXY adjustment. A commodity rising 5% while DXY falls 3% has only gained ~2% in real terms. Always adjust commodity moves for dollar changes before interpreting the signal. When commodities rise in DXY-adjusted terms, the demand signal is genuine.

### Semiconductor Spot Prices
DRAM and NAND spot prices function as a real-time semiconductor demand tracker:
- **Spot prices making new highs**: Demand exceeding supply; semiconductor cycle healthy
- **Spot prices peaking and turning**: Leading indicator for revenue trajectory of semiconductor companies
- Context matters: HBM-driven strength masks weakness in legacy DRAM spot prices

### Commodity Price Indices
- **GSCI +3% MoM**: Broad commodity inflation signal
- **LME index +2% MoM**: Industrial metals — growth expectations embedded in prices
- **CRB index +1.5% MoM**: Composite commodity inflation
- These indices moving up simultaneously with DXY weakening = classic "everything rally" risk-on signal

## Cross-Asset Divergence / Convergence Detection

### Divergence Framework
A divergence occurs when assets that should move together (based on historical correlation) begin moving in opposite directions.

**High-Alpha Divergences**:
1. **Risk assets rally while credit spreads widen**: Equity running ahead of credit
2. **EM outperforms while US yield advantage widening**: EM borrowing from future returns
3. **Gold rises while dollar also rises**: Dual safe-haven demand — flight from the system
4. **Nasdaq rallies while semiconductors underperform**: Sector leadership breakdown within tech
5. **Global policy divergence**: When central banks diverge sharply in policy direction, the dollar regime is extended until policy re-converges

### Convergence Framework
When divergent assets eventually reconnect with their historical relationship, the correction is often sharp.

"이격 해소" (gap resolution) = the convergence process. Track:
- The size of the divergence in standard deviation terms
- The historical average time for resolution
- Which direction the resolution typically occurs (does the laggard catch up, or does the leader fall back?)

### Safe-Haven Easing Confirmation Protocol
Before entering a HY long position after a risk-off period, confirm safe-haven easing:
1. Gold price stabilizing or declining (no longer rising as safe haven)
2. DXY declining below 99-100 level (safe-haven USD bid fading)
3. VIX term structure returning to contango (no longer in backwardation)
4. HY spreads tightening (credit confirming the risk-on shift)
All four must confirm before the risk-on rotation is validated.

## Sector Rotation Signals

### Macro-Driven Sector Rotation Map

| Macro Regime | Outperforming Sectors | Underperforming Sectors |
|--------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 실적장세 | Tech, Consumer Discretionary, Industrials | Utilities, Staples |
| 역금융장세 | Energy, Materials, Financials | Tech, Growth, Duration |
| 역실적장세 | Utilities, Staples, Healthcare | Everything cyclical |
| 유동성 쏠림 | US large-cap quality | EM equities, HY bonds, Speculative commodities |

### Materials Sector as Macro Signal
Materials sector PE relative to its own 10-year historical average is a commodity expectations barometer:

- **PE near or below historical mean**: Commodity market not yet pricing an inflationary cycle
- **PE 1-2σ above historical mean**: Commodity expectations beginning to be priced into equities
- **PE 2σ+ above historical mean**: Forward commodity prices already embedded in multiples; late-cycle commodity positioning signal
- **PE 3σ+ above historical mean**: Extreme; commodity bull case is fully priced. Sell signal for Materials

### Sector Rotation Breadth Analysis
Monitor the breadth of sector participation (McClellan Oscillator, advancing/declining stocks ratio). When market index is making new highs but breadth is narrowing (fewer sectors participating), the rally is concentrated and vulnerable. DXY level above the sustainability threshold (~104+) constrains the breadth of sectors that can participate in a rally.

### Bitcoin Dominance as Risk Appetite Indicator
Bitcoin dominance (BTC market cap / total crypto market cap) rising while altcoins fall = risk appetite within the speculative asset class is narrowing. This mirrors the "quality over speculation" dynamic in equity markets and confirms the 양털깎기 regime.
