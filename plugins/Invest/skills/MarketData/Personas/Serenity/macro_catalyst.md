# Serenity Macro Catalyst Framework

## Overview

Macro framework that works UP from physical supply chains, not DOWN from macro indicators. Level 1 of the 6-Level Analytical Hierarchy (see `methodology.md`), determining timing and risk regime for positions already identified through bottleneck analysis. Core question: "How does the macro affect the specific companies I've already identified as supply chain bottleneck plays?"

> "Stay long in the AI buildout, fundamentals matter more than macro and short term liquidity shock"

## Fed Policy Transmission Mechanisms

### Rate Cuts -> Growth Stock Valuation (DCF Impact)
- Rate cuts reduce discount rate on forward earnings, expanding growth stock valuations
- "With a triple rate cut, growth and small caps tend to surge"
- Historical: only 3 triple-cut events in 25 years (2001, 2008-09, 2020)
- Key: This is a specific DCF impact on forward earnings, NOT a general "risk-on" argument

### Rate Cuts -> Neocloud Thesis (Direct)
- "Far out earnings of billions in rev get marked UP" with rate cut projections
- Lower rates directly reduce cost of capital for capital-intensive AI buildout companies
- This is quantifiable DCF impact, not sentiment

### Rate Uncertainty -> Credit Differentiation
- Higher rates kill weak balance sheets while benefiting cash-rich companies
- "Companies like APLD failed to sell bonds... bonds were sold at 97 cents on the dollar"
- Rate uncertainty is a FEATURE for strong balance sheets -- destroys weaker competitors

### Rate Cuts -> Stablecoin Impact (Complex)
- "40bps move in rates led to multiple contraction of 55%" -- same macro event can be bullish for one sector and bearish for another
- Challenge: can stablecoin supply growth offset rate income decline?

### Sell-the-News Dynamic
- Institutions front-run rate cuts. Buy BEFORE the catalyst, not on the news.

### Monitoring: rate expectations data, yield and spread data

## Geopolitical Risk Analysis

### US-China Export Controls -> Investable Supply Chain Disruptions

> **Guardrail**: The following are historical examples of how geopolitical events created bottleneck opportunities. For new geopolitical scenarios, independently trace the affected supply chains using the Discovery Workflow in `supply_chain_bottleneck.md` (Scenario-Driven Discovery Protocol, Step 1-6) and the Top-Down Theme Discovery Workflow in `methodology.md`. Do not default to these tickers as starting points.

Each restriction creates a specific bottleneck opportunity by removing supply from global markets. The analytical pattern: identify what material/component is restricted -> trace who supplies the Western alternative -> apply 6-Criteria Bottleneck Scoring.

*Historical Applications:*
- China InP export restrictions to Japan -> AXTI becomes effective Western monopoly
- China Germanium export ban -> LPTH sole Western alternative via Black Diamond material
- China rare earth restrictions -> WWR, DFLI opportunities
- "Not everyday do you have foreign governments telling you what to buy"

*When a new export control or sanction is announced, execute the Discovery Workflow independently: classify the event (Step 1), map affected supply chains (Step 2-3), find concentration points (Step 4), score bottlenecks (Step 5), validate fundamentals (Step 6).*

### Administration Trade Policy Framework
- **"Maximum Pressure rhetoric"** -> TACO Trade (Tariff Anxiety Creates Opportunity)
- Markets overreact to known information: "None of this was new information" -- creating entry points
- Administration views equity markets as approval rating -> limits truly destructive policies
- "This volatility is often a 'valuation gift' since these are all empty threats"

### National Security as Investment Thesis
- AI, Space, Energy, Minerals, Quantum are national security verticals
- Government equity stakes and supply chain executive orders -> direct catalysts
- "Never bet against the White House"

### Classification Rule
Distinguish REAL catalysts (material to forward earnings, change supply chain structure) from noise (tariff theater, shutdown headlines). Noise creates buying opportunities.

### Macro-to-Bottleneck Bridge
When a macro catalyst is identified as REAL (material to forward earnings or supply chain structure), the analysis should flow into the Discovery Workflow in `supply_chain_bottleneck.md` for bottleneck identification. Do not stop at the macro level. The sequence: macro event classification (this file) -> supply chain impact mapping -> bottleneck scoring -> fundamental validation (Discovery Workflow in `supply_chain_bottleneck.md` and `methodology.md`).

## CapEx Flow Tracking Methodology

### Hyperscaler Capex: THE Leading Indicator
- "The biggest signal of whether the AI trade continues is hyperscaler spending"
- Key hyperscalers to track quarterly: GOOGL, META, MSFT, AMZN

### Supply Chain Cascade
Demand flows down; each layer validates the next:
1. Hyperscaler capex -> 2. Neocloud deals (NBIS, CIFR, IREN) -> 3. Semiconductors (TSM, NVDA, AVGO) -> 4. Memory (MU, SK Hynix) -> 5. Substrates/optics (AXTI, LITE, COHR) -> 6. Raw materials (InP, Germanium, Indium)

If hyperscaler capex accelerates, all downstream benefits. If it decelerates, re-evaluate the entire chain.

### Earnings as Proxy Validators
- TSM earnings -> semiconductor demand proxy -> validates neocloud revenue
- META capex increase -> more neocloud deals -> validates Mag7 capex funnel
- SNDK blowout -> confirms memory supercycle -> validates MU, SK Hynix
- ORCL GPU buildout failure at 14% margins -> proves software layer moat

## Liquidity Analysis

### Net Liquidity
Track net liquidity: Net liquidity = Fed balance sheet - TGA - RRP (directional indicator for risk assets).

### Four Liquidity Drains Framework
Diagnose sell-offs through multiple simultaneous drains, not single-cause narratives:
1. **Crypto precursor shock** -- early warning signal
2. **Fed policy uncertainty** -- rate cut odds declining
3. **AI credit stress** -- weak neocloud debt burden, bond failures
4. **Carry trade unwind** -- BoJ rate hikes squeezing leveraged positions

### Application Rules
- Single drain: noise, maintain positions
- Two drains: monitor closely, tighten stops
- Three+ drains: reduce leverage, maintain conviction positions, prepare dry powder
- "Markets are selling off because of 'perception' rather than any formal policy change" -- perception-driven selling creates buying opportunities

## Seasonal and Cyclical Patterns

### September Weakness
Historical pattern, but institutions front-run it (can negate entirely). When weakness is consensus, September can rally. Do not blindly position for it.

### Tax Harvesting (Nov-Dec) -> January Effect
High-conviction seasonal pattern: institutional tax-loss harvesting (Oct-Nov) creates artificial selling in beaten-down names. Wash sale windows expire late Dec / early Jan. Build positions in tax-harvested names during November-December for January mean reversion rally.

### Government Shutdown
"Historically stocks drop on the news but increase near the tail end." IMMATERIAL catalyst -- use the panic to buy.

---

## Catalyst Monitoring Framework

Priority order for real-time tracking:

1. **Hyperscaler capex announcements** -- THE leading indicator for AI trade
2. **TSM earnings/guidance** -- semiconductor demand proxy
3. **Supply chain status** -- InP, HBM, GPU lead times
4. **Fed rate expectations** -- via rate probability tools, Polymarket, Fed futures
5. **Credit markets** -- can neoclouds raise capital? Bond yields for AI companies?
6. **Geopolitical headlines** -- material vs noise classification
7. **Fear and Greed Index** -- Extreme Fear = buying opportunity
8. **Seasonal calendar** -- September, tax harvesting, January Effect, shutdown timing
9. **ARKK** -- "canary in the coal mine" for bubble risk
10. **Commodity prices** -- Indium, Germanium for bottleneck validation

---

## Contrarian Timing Entry

### Fear-Based Entry
- "Best time to buy is on extreme fear when retail are selling"
- Fear and Greed Index integration (Extreme Fear < 25 = buying zone)
- DCA approach on dips, never try to time exact bottom

### Regime Detection
- VIX term structure: contango (normal) vs backwardation (stress) for regime identification
- net liquidity data for macro liquidity regime

### Inverse Indicators
- Jim Cramer, Cathie Wood as contrarian signals
- When consensus is overwhelmingly bearish on quality names, it is usually time to accumulate

## Macro-to-Micro Transmission Pathways

- **Rate Cuts -> Cost of Capital -> Capex -> Supply Chain**: Fed cuts -> hyperscaler capex expands -> more GPU/HBM/InP/optics demand
- **Export Controls -> Supply Disruption -> Monopoly Premium**: China restricts exports -> Western bottleneck company gains pricing power
- **Tariff Noise -> Panic Selling -> "TACO Trade" Entry**: Administration announces tariffs -> market sells off on perception -> fundamentals unchanged -> enter at lower prices
- **Earnings Miss (Optical) -> Algo Selling -> Contrarian Buy**: Accounting anomaly (BBB tax, GAAP vs adjusted) -> algos sell headline -> forward earnings unchanged -> buy the dip
- **Seasonal Pressure -> Tax Harvesting -> January Recovery**: Institutions harvest losses Nov-Dec -> quality names oversold -> mean reversion rally in January
- **Credit Stress -> Weak Player Elimination -> Concentration**: Higher rates -> weak balance sheets fail to refinance -> market share shifts to cash-rich players

---

## Decision Rules

1. **Hyperscaler capex accelerating**: Stay long AI supply chain -- this is THE signal
2. **Geopolitical noise without fundamental change**: Buy the dip -- "valuation gift"
3. **Rate cuts confirmed**: Overweight growth, small caps, neoclouds -- once-in-a-decade
4. **Credit stress rising**: Differentiate by balance sheet -- exit weak (CRWV, APLD), concentrate in strong (NBIS)
5. **Seasonal selling active**: Build positions for January recovery
6. **Supply chain disruption**: Identify the bottleneck company -- refer to `supply_chain_bottleneck.md`
7. **Multiple liquidity drains**: Reduce leverage, maintain conviction, prepare dry powder -- the ONLY scenario where caution overrides supply chain conviction
