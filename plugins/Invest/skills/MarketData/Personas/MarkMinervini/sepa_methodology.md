# SEPA Methodology (Specific Entry Point Analysis)

## Overview

SEPA is Mark Minervini's proprietary methodology that combines corporate fundamentals with the technical behavior of a stock. It is rooted in reverse factor modeling: studying the best stocks historically to find the best stocks going forward. SEPA demands convergence across fundamentals, technicals, qualitative factors, and market tone simultaneously -- not any single factor in isolation.

---

## The 5 SEPA Elements

### 1. Trend

Virtually every superperformance phase occurs while the stock price is in a definite uptrend. The trend is identifiable early in the superperformance advance.

### 2. Fundamentals

Most superperformance phases are driven by improvement in earnings, revenue, and margins. This materializes before the start of the superperformance phase. Earnings and sales are on the table and measurable early on.

### 3. Catalyst

Every stock that makes a huge gain has a catalyst behind it. Types include: new hot-selling product, FDA approval, newly awarded contract, new CEO, technological revolution, deregulation event, cult-like product following.

Key example: Apple stock price increased 10,000% from 2003 low; 73% of that growth came from newly launched products.

### 4. Entry Points

Most superperformance stocks give at least one opportunity to catch a meteoric rise at a low-risk entry point. Time the entry correctly during a bull market and you could be at a profit immediately.

### 5. Exit Points

Not all stocks with superperformance characteristics result in gains. You must establish stop-loss points. The end of a superperformance phase needs to be identified to keep what you have made.

---

## Probability Convergence Principle

Execute a trade only at the point of alignment across the spectrum: company fundamentals, stock price/volume activity, and overall market conditions. Like four cars arriving at a four-way intersection at the same time.

The collective value of these parameters is greater than the sum of their parts. By demanding stocks cross multiple hurdles -- fundamental, technical, qualitative, and market tone -- you are far more likely to identify something exceptional.

---

## SEPA 4-Stage Ranking/Filtering Process

### Stage 1: Trend Template Filter

Stocks must meet all 8 Trend Template criteria (defined in agent definition). This is the initial nonnegotiable filter.

### Stage 2: Quantitative Screening

Stocks passing the Trend Template are screened through filters for earnings, sales, margin growth, relative strength, and price volatility. Approximately 95% of stocks that qualify under the Trend Template fail this screen.

### Stage 3: Leadership Profile Comparison

Remaining stocks are scrutinized for similarities to the Leadership Profile -- specific fundamental and technical factors exhibited by historical superperformers.

### Stage 4: Manual Review and Relative Prioritizing

A narrowed list is examined individually and scored on:
- Reported earnings/sales and surprise history
- EPS growth and acceleration
- Revenue growth and acceleration
- Company-issued guidance
- Analyst estimate revisions
- Profit margins
- Industry and market position
- Potential catalysts
- Performance vs sector peers
- Price and volume analysis
- Liquidity risk

The ranking process focuses on identifying potential for: (1) future earnings/sales surprises and positive estimate revisions, (2) institutional volume support, (3) rapid price appreciation from supply/demand imbalance.

## Market Timing via Leader Behavior

### Bottom-Up Approach

Let individual stocks lead you into an industry group or sector. The best stocks in leading groups advance before it is obvious that the group is hot. Focus on stocks and let them point you to the group.

### 52-Week New High List Monitoring

Track the 52-week new high list. The industry groups with a healthy number of stocks hitting new highs early in a bull market will often be the leaders. Your portfolio should consist of the best companies in the top four or five sectors.

### Leader-Based Market Timing Signals

- More than 90% of superperformance stocks emerge from bear markets or significant corrections
- The first 4-8 weeks of a new bull market identify the true leaders for the entire cycle
- When the leader in a group breaks badly, the whole group can suffer
- If one or more important stocks in an industry group top, that is a warning the whole group will run into trouble

---

## Lockout Rally Recognition

The initial surge in a new bull market where pullbacks are contained to 3-5% peak to trough. These early rallies "lock out" hesitant buyers waiting for a pullback that never comes. The strongest moves occur when skepticism is highest.

---

## Sector Leadership Rotation Patterns

- 3 to 4 to as many as 8 to 10 industry groups or subgroups lead a new bull market
- Leadership groups can start their rallies before the broad benchmark bottom
- Groups that have historically produced the largest superperformers: Consumer/retail, Technology/computer/software, Drugs/medical/biotech, Leisure/entertainment
- More than 60% of superperformance stocks were part of an industry group advance

---

## Six Company Categories

### 1. Market Leaders

Industry's number one, two, or three in sales and earnings, gaining market share. Grow earnings at 20%+ (many average 35-45% during best 5-10 year stretch). During greatest growth, some increase earnings at triple-digit rates.

Subcategories:
- **Category Killer**: Brand/market position so strong that competing is nearly impossible even with unlimited capital. Examples: eBay, Apple, Disney, Walmart.
- **Cookie Cutter Concept**: Successful formula replicated over and over. Examples: McDonald's, Walmart, Starbucks, Home Depot, Costco. Same-store sales of 10%+ is healthy; 25-30%+ is unsustainable. Opening 100+ stores/year is difficult to maintain.

### 2. Top Competitors

Not the superior company but in the right place at the right time. Same rapidly growing industry as the leader but products may be less popular. Can produce high rates of earnings growth, albeit inferior to the leader.

### 3. Institutional Favorites

Mature blue chips with consistent sales and dividend growth. Earnings growth in low to middle teens. Widely followed, little room for rapid price appreciation. Not likely to produce superperformance moves.

### 4. Turnaround Situations

Look for very strong results in the most recent two or three quarters. At least two quarters of strong earnings increases or one quarter up enough to move trailing 12-month EPS near or above its old peak. Require current earnings very strong (+100% or better in most recent one or two quarters).

### 5. Cyclical Stocks

Sensitive to economy or commodity prices. Have an INVERSE P/E cycle: high P/E when poised to rally, low P/E near end of cycle.

### 6. Past Leaders and Laggards

Inferior price performance and usually inferior earnings/sales growth. Appear relatively cheaper -- which attracts unskilled investors. "More times than not, the expensive market leader is actually cheap and the laggard is really the more expensive choice."

### Company Category Classification Guide

When classifying a stock, use these decision points in order:

1. Check prior cycle status first: Was RS 90+ in prior cycle, now declining? -> Past Leader/Laggard
2. Check P/E cycle: Is P/E inversely correlated with earnings cycle? -> Cyclical
3. Check market position: Top 3 in industry by revenue, gaining share, 20%+ EPS growth? -> Market Leader
4. Check earnings trajectory: Recent 1-2 quarters +100%+ from negative/flat base? -> Turnaround
5. Check growth profile: Same hot industry as leader but inferior metrics? -> Top Competitor
6. Default: Consistent 10-15% growth, widely held, mature? -> Institutional Favorite

Data points required: industry rank, EPS growth rate, P/E pattern, recent earnings trajectory, prior cycle RS history.

Category-specific risk adjustments:
- Turnaround: Code 33 reliability is lower (short track record). Require 2+ quarters of strong results before full conviction.
- Cyclical: Do not apply standard P/E framework. Use inverse P/E logic from `earnings_insights.md`.
- Past Leader: <25% repeat probability. Require full base reset (Stage 4 -> Stage 1 -> fresh Stage 2).

---

## Broken Leader Syndrome

Investors who refused to buy a dynamic new leader when it was emerging become interested after it has topped and broken down in price during a stage 4 decline. When a leader tops, the stock price is usually discounting a future slowdown in growth.

Key statistics:
- Fewer than 25% of market leaders in one cycle lead the next
- About one-third of superperformers give back all of their advance and sometimes more
- Subsequent price declines average 50-70%

Sun Microsystems example: investors who bought at 75% off the high lost 99% of their capital.

---

## Leaders Lead on Both Sides

Leading stocks in a healthy market advance 15-20%, then rest and pull back 5-10% before resuming. But when leaders break, they lead to the downside too. The same stocks that led the advance will often show the earliest signs of a market top.

---

## Conservative Aggressive Opportunist

Minervini's self-described identity: aggressive in pursuit of potential reward while extremely risk-conscious. The foundation is always "How much can I lose?" before "How much can I gain?" This is not conservatism -- it is aggressive opportunism with risk discipline.

---

## Fundamentally Sound vs Price-Ready

A good company does NOT equal a good stock. Even perfect fundamentals -- accelerating earnings, expanding margins, dominant market position -- do not make a stock a buy. The key is to align supporting fundamentals with constructive price action during a healthy overall market environment.

The distinction is critical: a stock can be fundamentally sound (excellent company with strong growth) without being price-ready (proper technical setup for low-risk entry). SEPA demands both conditions simultaneously. Many investors lose money buying great companies at the wrong time because they ignore the technical readiness of the stock.

The correct approach: know what the stock SHOULD do based on its fundamental profile, then wait and verify that the price/volume behavior confirms the setup. Like waiting for a train to arrive on schedule -- you know the timetable (fundamentals suggest a move), but you wait for the train to actually arrive at the station (price/volume alignment at a proper pivot) before boarding.

---

## Volume's Role in SEPA Probability Convergence

Volume is the footprint of institutional money. Price shows direction; volume shows conviction. In SEPA, volume confirmation is not optional -- it is a required convergence factor alongside fundamentals, technicals, and market tone.

### Up/Down Volume Ratio Interpretation

The Up/Down Volume Ratio measures the ratio of total volume on up-days to total volume on down-days over a lookback period.

- **50-day ratio > 1.5**: Strong accumulation. Institutions are actively buying. Bullish for Stage 2 continuation.
- **50-day ratio 1.15-1.5**: Moderate accumulation. Healthy but not exceptional.
- **50-day ratio 0.85-1.15**: Neutral. No clear institutional direction.
- **50-day ratio 0.7-0.85**: Mild distribution. Caution warranted.
- **50-day ratio < 0.7**: Heavy distribution. Institutions are selling. Stage 3/4 likely.

The **20-day ratio** provides an early warning signal. When the 20-day ratio diverges significantly from the 50-day ratio, it signals a transition:
- 20-day ratio deteriorating while 50-day holds: Early Stage 2->3 transition warning.
- 20-day ratio improving while 50-day is weak: Potential Stage 1->2 emergence.

### Distribution Day Counting and Clustering

A Distribution Day occurs when price declines >= 0.2% on above-average volume. Individual distribution days are normal during Stage 2 advances. However, **clustering** of distribution days (3+ within a 25-trading-day window) is a significant warning signal that institutional selling is concentrated and sustained.

Key rules:
- 4-5 distribution days within 25 trading days: Elevated risk, tighten stops.
- 6+ distribution days within 25 trading days: Serious distribution, consider reducing exposure.
- Distribution days that reset after a strong advance on high volume can be ignored.

### Stage-Specific Expected Volume Patterns

- **Stage 1**: Volume contracts significantly (50-day avg often < 70% of 200-day avg). Low interest.
- **Stage 2**: Up-volume dominates. Accumulation days > distribution days. Breakouts on 50%+ above-average volume.
- **Stage 3**: Volume spikes on down days. Distribution days cluster. Up/down ratio deteriorates from 20-day first.
- **Stage 4**: Persistent high-volume selling. Down-volume dominates. Climactic capitulation days possible.

### Breakout Volume Confirmation Checklist

Before confirming a breakout as valid:
1. Volume on breakout day >= 25% above 50-day average (minimum); ideal is 50-100%+.
2. Up/Down volume ratio (50d) shows accumulation (> 1.15).
3. No distribution day cluster in the prior 25 trading days.
4. Pullback volume (if any) should be declining -- supply drying up.
5. No climactic sell days (volume >= 2x average on down days) in the prior 10 trading days.

## Overhead Supply Mechanics

When a stock declines from its high, it creates overhead supply -- the accumulated shares held by buyers who purchased at higher prices and are now at a loss. These trapped buyers create selling pressure at two critical points:

- **Breakeven sellers**: Investors who bought near the highs and are underwater. As price recovers toward their purchase price, many will sell to "get even," creating supply at former resistance levels.
- **Bottom fishers taking profit**: Traders who bought during the decline often sell quickly once they have a modest profit, adding to supply on rallies.

The VCP pattern progressively absorbs this overhead supply through successive contractions. Each contraction cycle shakes out another layer of weak holders. By the time the final contraction occurs (the tightest one), the remaining holders are committed and the overhead supply has been substantially absorbed.

As a trader using a stop-loss, you are a weak holder. The key is to be the last weak holder -- to buy at the point where the supply of weak holders has been exhausted by the VCP process, so that your entry coincides with the moment of minimum remaining supply.

## 4-Stage Stock Lifecycle

### Stage 1: The Neglect Phase (Consolidation)

**Characteristics:**
- Price moves sideways with no sustained upward or downward movement
- Price oscillates around its 200-day (40-week) moving average
- This dead-in-the-water phase can last months or even years
- Often follows a stage 4 decline of several months or more
- Volume is generally contracted and relatively light compared to the previous stage 4 decline
- Earnings, sales, and margins may be lackluster or erratic

**Rule**: Avoid buying during Stage 1 no matter how tempting. Even if fundamentals look appealing, wait and buy only in Stage 2.

### Transition from Stage 1 to Stage 2 (7 Signals)

1. Stock price is above both the 150-day and 200-day moving average
2. The 150-day MA is above the 200-day MA
3. The 200-day MA has turned up
4. A series of higher highs and higher lows has occurred
5. Large up weeks on volume spikes contrasted by low-volume pullbacks
6. More up weeks on volume than down weeks on volume
7. There should ALWAYS be a previous rally with an escalation in price of at least 25 to 30 percent off the 52-week low BEFORE concluding a Stage 2 advance is under way

### Stage 2: The Advancing Phase (Accumulation)

**Characteristics:**
- Price above its 200-day MA; the 200-day MA itself is in an uptrend
- 150-day MA above the 200-day MA
- Clear uptrend: higher highs and higher lows in a staircase pattern
- Short-term MAs above long-term MAs (50-day above 150-day)
- Volume spikes on big up days/weeks; volume contraction during pullbacks
- More up days/weeks on above-average volume than down days/weeks
- Big institutional players buy the stock in size

**Virtually every superperformance stock made its big gain while in Stage 2.**

### Deep Correction Relative Rule

Most constructive Stage 2 setups correct between 10% and 35% from their highs. When evaluating correction depth, it must be assessed relative to the general market decline during the same period. A stock that corrects 2-3 times more than the S&P 500 during the same timeframe should be avoided, as this excessive relative weakness signals underlying problems that the market is pricing in.

Stocks correcting 60% or more from their highs almost always signal serious fundamental deterioration. Even if the stock eventually recovers, the probability of a successful Stage 2 breakout from such a deep base is significantly lower than from a shallower correction. The deeper the correction, the greater the overhead supply of trapped buyers wanting breakeven, which creates persistent resistance on every rally attempt.

### Stage 3: The Topping Phase (Distribution)

**Characteristics:**
- Volatility increases; stock moves in wider, looser swings; price movement is erratic
- Usually a major price break on increased volume -- often the largest one-day decline since the beginning of the Stage 2 advance
- Stock price may undercut its 200-day MA; volatility around the 200-day is common
- 200-day MA loses upside momentum, flattens out, then rolls over
- Smart money selling into final signs of price strength
- Distribution: changing hands from strong buyers to weaker ones

### Stage 2→3 Transition Risk Assessment

The `transition_risk` field from stage_analysis quantifies how close Stage 3 is to overtaking Stage 2:

- **high** (gap < 20): Stage 3 is actively competing. The stock may appear Stage 2 but is on the edge. Use signature phrase: "전환 구간을 인식하라." Tighten stops, reduce new position sizing.
- **moderate** (gap < 40): Stage 3 characteristics are emerging but Stage 2 still dominant. Watch for: 200MA flattening, distribution day clustering, volatility expansion.
- **low** (gap >= 40): Clear Stage 2 with minimal transition risk. Standard SEPA rules apply.

Transition risk is most dangerous because the stock still passes the Trend Template (price above MAs, bullish alignment) while the underlying dynamics are shifting. The largest single-day decline since Stage 2 began is a key confirming signal -- if this has already occurred, transition risk is elevated regardless of the score gap.

### Stage 4: The Declining Phase (Capitulation)

**Characteristics:**
- Vast majority of price action is BELOW the 200-day MA
- 200-day MA is in a definite downtrend
- Stock price near or hitting 52-week new lows
- Series of lower lows and lower highs, stair-stepping downward
- Short-term MAs below long-term MAs
- Volume spikes on big down days/weeks; low-volume rallies
- Earnings models generally revised downward

**Rule**: Definitely avoid buying while a stock is in Stage 4.

## Alternative Entry Techniques

Beyond the standard pivot breakout, SEPA provides three additional entry techniques that can improve timing and reduce risk within a confirmed base formation.

### Pocket Pivot

A pocket pivot is an up-day where volume exceeds the maximum volume of any down-day in the prior 10 sessions. It signals institutional buying within the base, even before a formal breakout. Pocket pivots are most significant when they occur on the right side of a base, above the 50-day moving average, and while the stock is still consolidating (not extended). A high-quality pocket pivot provides an early entry opportunity with tighter risk control than waiting for the pivot breakout.

### Low Cheat Setup

The low cheat occurs when price consolidates tightly just below a pivot point. By entering during this tight zone rather than waiting for the pivot breakout, the trader gets a lower entry price and a closer stop-loss, reducing the risk percentage per share. The key requirements are: consolidation range < 3%, all closes within 5% below the pivot price, and volume drying up (average volume well below the 50-day average). The mathematical advantage is clear -- the same stop-loss level produces a smaller percentage risk from a lower entry price.

### Tight Closes

Tight closes occur when a stock's closing prices cluster within a very narrow range (< 1-1.5%) over consecutive days or weeks. This pattern signals extreme supply dryup as sellers are exhausted and the stock is coiling for a potential move. Daily tight closes are common in the handle area of Cup & Handle patterns and near pivot areas of VCPs. Weekly tight closes carry even more significance due to the compressed timeframe. Tight closes combined with declining volume near a pivot area represent one of the strongest confirming signals for an imminent breakout.

### 3C Pattern (Cup Completion Cheat)

The 3C pattern is the earliest actionable entry point within a cup formation, occurring before the cup fully completes. It is based on the "Making the Turn" A-B-C-D sequence:

- **A**: An intermediate downtrend develops within a Stage 2 advance. Price declines from a prior high, forming the left side of a cup.
- **B**: A rally breaks the intermediate downtrend line. This is a sign of potential recovery but NOT a buy point -- there is no confirmation yet that the stock will complete the cup.
- **C**: After the B rally, price pauses and forms a plateau. This is the cheat area. The pause is typically a 5-10% range consolidation, ideally accompanied by a shakeout and volume dryup. The stock has recovered approximately one-third to one-half of the cup decline at this point.
- **D**: Price breaks above the pause high. This is the 3C entry point -- the Cup Completion Cheat buy trigger.

Qualification criteria for a valid 3C setup:

- Prior advance of 25-100%+ before the cup formation began
- Stock price above a rising 200-day moving average
- Cup formation duration between 3 and 45 weeks
- Recovery from the cup bottom of approximately 33-50% at the time of the pause
- Volume dryup during the pause/plateau phase
- Tight price action during the pause (5-10% range)

The 3C is distinct from the Low Cheat entry. The Low Cheat refers to tight consolidation below any pivot point to get a lower entry price. The 3C specifically refers to the cup recovery position -- entering during the pause that occurs as the stock makes the turn from the cup bottom before the full cup-and-handle formation completes. A 3C entry may also qualify as a Low Cheat if the pause zone is tight enough, but the concepts address different structural features.
