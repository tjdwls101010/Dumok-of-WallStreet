# Williams Short-Term Trading: Patterns & Setups

## Overview

Williams' short-term trading approach combines structural bar patterns, calendar biases (TDW/TDM), and volatility-based entries to identify explosive 2-5 day moves. Every pattern is based on the same underlying principle: the public gets trapped by emotional reactions to apparent breakouts or breakdowns, and the immediate reversal of those moves creates high-probability entries for informed traders. No pattern should be traded in isolation -- each requires confirmation from setup criteria including TDW, intermarket relationships, overbought/oversold conditions, and trend context.

## Five Chart Patterns

### 1. Outside Day Reversal

**Definition**: A day whose range completely engulfs the prior day's range (higher high AND lower low) that closes lower than the prior day's close.

**Bar-by-bar construction**:
- Day 0: Normal trading day establishing a range
- Day 1 (Outside Day): High > Day 0 High, Low < Day 0 Low, Close < Day 0 Close
- The market explored both directions but sellers won decisively

**Trading Rule**: Buy on the next day's open. In Bonds (1990-1998), trading outside day buy signals on any day except Thursday produced 90% accuracy on 41 trades, with an average profit of $420/trade and profit factor of 3.77. In the S&P 500 (1986-1998), outside days with down closes that occurred on Tuesday set up 25 Wednesday sell signals, of which 19 were winners netting $21,487.

**Electronic Era Status**: Outside days remain bullish even in electronic markets. Testing on the S&P E-Mini from 1998 forward confirmed similar results.

### 2. Smash Day (Naked Close)

**Definition**: A day that closes below the prior day's low (naked down close) or above the prior day's high (naked up close). This violent price action draws the public into the fray at exactly the wrong moment.

**Buy Setup**:
- Day 1: Close < Prior day's Low (naked down close). May also take out 3-8 days of lows
- Day 2: If price trades ABOVE Day 1's High, buy immediately
- The immediate reversal means the public's breakout has failed -- they swallowed the hook

**Sell Setup**:
- Day 1: Close > Prior day's High (naked up close)
- Day 2: If price trades BELOW Day 1's Low, sell immediately

**Key Requirement**: The reversal must occur the VERY NEXT DAY. The pattern's power comes from the immediacy of the failure. If several days pass without reversal, the original breakout may be valid.

**Trading Rule**: Use this pattern in two contexts:
1. **Trend continuation**: In a strong trend, a smash day against the trend is a pullback entry. The trend is intact and ready for another push.
2. **Range breakout failure**: In a 5-10 day choppy range, a smash day followed by immediate reversal suggests a breakout in the opposite direction, as all the stops were triggered and the "breakout babies" were trapped.

### 3. Hidden Smash Day

**Definition**: A day that closes UP for the day but in the bottom 25% of its range (and ideally below the open). The up close masks the fact that buyers got smashed -- price rallied and then collapsed, but the chartist sees only "up close" and misses the failure.

**Buy Setup**:
- Day 1: Close > Prior Close (up day), but Close is in the lower 25% of the day's range (High - Low). Best patterns also have Close < Open
- Day 2: If price rallies above Day 1's High, buy -- the failed selling is being reversed

**Sell Setup** (mirror image):
- Day 1: Close < Prior Close (down day), but Close is in the upper 25% of the range and above the Open
- Day 2: If price drops below Day 1's Low, sell

**Rationale**: What happened is that price either gapped up and then sold off to close barely above the prior close, or rallied sharply intraday and then gave back nearly all gains. The buyers were "hidden smashed." If the next day immediately reverses and takes out the smash day's high, the trapped sellers are in trouble.

### 4. Specialists' Trap (Wyckoff Trap)

**Definition**: Derived from Richard Wyckoff's 1930s work on market manipulation. A false breakout from a 5-10 day congestion zone that reverses within 1-3 days.

**Sell Trap Setup**:
- Market is in an uptrend and enters a 5-10 day sideways box/congestion
- Price breaks out to the upside with a naked close above the entire trading range
- Within 1-3 days, price falls below the true low of the breakout day
- This signals the upside breakout was false -- distributors unloaded to the public on strength

**Buy Trap Setup** (mirror image):
- Down-trending market stabilizes sideways for 5-10 days
- Price breaks below with a naked close lower than all daily lows of the range
- Within 1-3 days, price snaps back above the true high of the breakdown day
- All sell stops below the range were triggered; the public is now afraid to buy the reversal

**Critical Point**: The true low (for sell traps) or true high (for buy traps) of the breakout day becomes the key level. Its violation within 1-3 days is the entry signal.

### 5. Oops! Pattern

**Definition**: The most reliable short-term pattern Williams ever traded, based on an overemotional gap response that immediately reverses.

**Buy Setup**:
- Market gaps down, opening below the prior day's low
- During the same session, price recovers back up to the prior day's low
- Buy at the prior day's low -- the gap down was an emotional overreaction that trapped sellers

**Sell Setup** (mirror image):
- Market gaps up, opening above the prior day's high
- Price falls back to the prior day's high
- Sell at the prior day's high

**Electronic Era Limitation**: This pattern has been greatly diminished by electronic trading. Because markets now close only a few hours before reopening, true gaps (open significantly beyond prior range) are much rarer. The pattern retains value on Sunday evening opens and after major news events, but it is no longer the workhorse it was in the pit era.

## Trading Day of the Week (TDW) Framework

Not all days of the week are created equal. This is one of Williams' most enduring discoveries, holding from the 1960s through 2011 and beyond. The random walk theory says there should be no day-of-week bias, but the data proves otherwise decisively.

### S&P 500 TDW Bias

| Day | Open-to-Close Bias | Historical Character |
|-----|-------------------|---------------------|
| Monday | Bullish (+$45 to +$91/trade) | Strongest buy day. 52-57% close above open |
| Tuesday | Bullish (+$56 to +$59/trade) | Second-best buy day |
| Wednesday | Slightly bearish (-$27/trade) | Weakest day; avoid buying |
| Thursday | Bearish (-$10 to -$37/trade) | Best sell day for short signals |
| Friday | Strongly bullish (+$109 to +$134/trade) | 57% close above open. Strongest absolute performance |

### Bond Market TDW Bias

| Day | Open-to-Close Bias | Historical Character |
|-----|-------------------|---------------------|
| Monday | Bullish (+$53/trade) | 54-55% up closes |
| Tuesday | Best buy day (+$64/trade) | Primary long entry day |
| Wednesday | Moderate (+$4 to +$16/trade) | Acceptable for longs |
| Thursday | Weak (-$17 to +$8/trade) | Avoid or use for shorts |
| Friday | Strong buy (+$22/trade) | Buy on volatility breakout. Largest daily range |

### Grain Markets TDW Bias

All grain markets show a pronounced tendency to rally more on Wednesdays than any other day. Soybeans on Wednesdays: $117 average profit per trade vs. $14 on Thursdays. This has persisted since the 1960s.

### TDW Application

TDW is used as a setup filter, not a standalone system. The best trades combine TDW bias with volatility breakouts and intermarket confirmation. For example, a Bond volatility breakout system restricted to buy on Tuesday/Thursday and sell on Wednesday/Thursday produced 84% accuracy with a profit factor of 1.85, compared to 80% accuracy trading all days.

## Trading Day of the Month (TDM) Framework

TDM measures the trading day number within each month (not calendar date). A month typically has 20-22 trading days. Holidays and weekends mean the trading day number differs from the calendar date.

### S&P 500 TDM Bias

- **Month Start Bullish Zone (TDM 1-4)**: Strong bullish bias. Four consecutive profitable trading days at the start of each month
- **Midmonth Weakness (TDM 5-7, 12-13)**: Negative expected returns. Avoid initiating new longs
- **End-of-Month Rally (TDM 19-22)**: The strongest and most reliable seasonal pattern. Three consecutive bullish days with strong profits
- **Best TDMs for buying**: 8, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22

### Bond Market TDM Bias

- **Best Buy Days**: TDM 10, 11, 12, 16, 20 (midmonth and end-of-month strength)
- **Worst Buy Days**: TDM 2, 14, 18 (avoid longs)
- **TDM 18 and 22**: Traditional Bond buy signals. Bond TDM 18 or 22 buy signals historically produced strong results when combined with trend confirmation

### Gold TDM Bias

- **Sweet Spot**: TDM 11 through 16 (midmonth rally tendency)
- **Also Strong**: TDM 3 and 4
- **Worst Day**: TDM 7 (strong sell bias) and TDM 17

### TDM Application

Like TDW, TDM is used as a setup -- a leading indicator of when to take action. Williams does not blindly trade TDM signals; he waits until TDM aligns with his other tools. The strongest trades occur when TDW and TDM point in the same direction simultaneously.

## Greatest Swing Value (GSV)

### Concept

GSV separates buying swings from selling swings by measuring:
- **Buy Swing**: Distance from Open to High on DOWN close days (the market could rally that much but failed to hold, closing down)
- **Sell Swing**: Distance from Open to Low on UP close days (the market could decline that much but failed to hold, closing up)

These are "failure swings" -- the market swung that far but could not follow through. Exceeding the average failure swing means something out of the ordinary is occurring.

### Formula

1. Calculate the buy swing (Open to High) for each of the past 4 days that had down closes
2. Average these 4 values
3. Multiply by 180% to get the entry threshold
4. Buy above the opening at this 180% value

Mirror logic for sells: average the sell swings (Open to Low) on up close days for 4 days, multiply by 180%, subtract from opening for sell entry.

### GSV Stop Placement

Use 225% of the 4-day average swing value as the stop distance. If price returns to this level after triggering entry, the momentum move has failed.

### Electronic Era Status

The GSV concept using the opening as reference has been greatly diminished by electronic trading. The opening is now essentially the prior close, so the Open-to-High/Low swing measure has lost its predictive power. However, the TDW data within the GSV framework still holds -- Fridays remain strong for Bonds, Tuesdays for stocks. Williams suggests future research using the prior day's high, low, or close as alternative reference points.

## Three-Bar High/Low Channel Pullback

A simple pullback buy system that uses a 3-bar channel:

- **Buy**: When price pulls back to the lowest low of the past 3 bars during an uptrend
- **Sell**: When price rallies to the highest high of the past 3 bars during a downtrend

This system works best as a re-entry technique after missing an initial breakout, allowing the trader to join the trend at a short-term oversold point.

---

## Month-End Trading Systems

### S&P Month-End Buy

Based on the consistent tendency for stock prices to rally around the first of the month:
- Enter long near TDM 19-22
- Exit after TDM 1-4 of the following month
- This captures the end-of-month/beginning-of-month bullish seasonal

### Bond TDM 18/22 Buy

Bonds show midmonth-to-end-of-month strength:
- Buy at TDM 18 or 22 with trend confirmation
- Exit using bailout technique or at first profitable opening
- Combine with volatility breakout entry for precision

---

## Willspread Indicator

### Concept

Willspread measures the relative relationship between a primary market and a secondary (related) market using exponential moving averages (EMAs) of their price ratio:

- Calculate the ratio of the primary market to the secondary market
- Apply a fast EMA and slow EMA to this ratio
- The difference between the fast and slow EMA is the Willspread value

### Application

When Willspread is positive and rising, the primary market is strengthening relative to its secondary market -- bullish for the primary. When negative and falling, the primary is weakening -- bearish. This provides an intermarket confirmation filter that avoids the trap of using price to predict price.

## Script Output Interpretation Guide

### Pattern Scan Output

When reviewing pattern scan results:
- **Pattern type**: Identify which of the 5 patterns was detected. Outside days and Smash days are the most frequent; Specialists' Traps and Oops! are rarer but higher-conviction
- **Reversal confirmation**: Has the immediate reversal (next day) already occurred? If so, the entry may have been missed. Williams' patterns require NEXT-DAY confirmation
- **Context**: A pattern in a strong trend (continuation) is higher probability than the same pattern in a choppy range. Check the swing point hierarchy for trend alignment
- **TDW filter**: Reject pattern signals that occur on historically unfavorable days for the instrument

### TDW/TDM Analysis Output

When interpreting calendar bias output:
- **Convergence**: The strongest signal occurs when both TDW and TDM point bullish simultaneously. A Monday (bullish TDW for S&P) that falls on TDM 20 (bullish TDM) is a high-conviction setup
- **Divergence**: When TDW is bullish but TDM is bearish (or vice versa), reduce position size or pass on the trade
- **Historical consistency**: TDW patterns have held for 40+ years across regime changes. If a TDW pattern appears broken in recent data, it may be a temporary anomaly rather than a regime shift
- **Integration with other signals**: TDW/TDM are SETUP conditions, not entry triggers. Use them to determine WHEN to look for volatility breakout or pattern entries, not as standalone buy/sell signals
