# Williams Short-Term Trading Patterns & Techniques

## Overview

Short-term trading methodology built on the discovery that markets are not random, combining time-based biases (trading day of week, trading day of month), volatility breakout systems, inter-market relationships, and specific chart patterns to identify high-probability 1-5 day trades. Originally developed for commodity futures but adaptable to US stock trading through index products and individual equities.

> "The most certain way to make money in the market is to have a small position and capture a large move."

> "It is not how often you trade that makes you a winner; after all, any fool can trade every day of the week. Old punters like myself know it is how often you don't trade, how selective you are, that will lead to a successful career."

## Core Philosophy

### Markets Are Not Random

Empirical evidence disproves the random walk theory. Specific days of the week, days of the month, and seasonal periods exhibit persistent, measurable biases in price direction and range. These biases have held for decades across stocks, bonds, and commodities. The market has a "memory" — past price patterns influence future price action in predictable, tradable ways.

### Stack the Deck

Never trade on a single indicator or pattern alone. The best trades come from layering multiple independent confirmations — combine time biases (TDW, TDM) with chart patterns, inter-market relationships (Bonds/Gold), and overbought/oversold conditions. The more factors aligned, the higher the probability. If the scales are not heavily unbalanced in your favor, why trade?

### Emotional Extremes Drive Reversals

The most reliable short-term patterns exploit emotional overreactions. When the public panics into selling or greedily chases breakouts, the resulting extreme price action often reverses sharply. Patterns that "look bad" to the average chartist are frequently the best buy signals.

### Think in Time Frames

Trend is a function of time. The more time in a trade, the more opportunity for trend to develop. Day traders limit themselves by curtailing potential trend — they need large positions for small moves, which is mathematically inverted from optimal. The ideal short-term time frame is 2-4 days, allowing enough time for trend to develop while still capturing short-term moves.

## Trading Day of the Week (TDW)

### Core Discovery

Not all days of the week produce equal results. Persistent biases exist across markets. These have been verified across decades of data and continue to hold in electronic markets.

### Stock Market (S&P 500) TDW Biases

| Day | Bias | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Monday | Strong bullish | Best day to buy stocks. 57% close above open, average +$109 open-to-close. Rallies are strongest on Mondays. |
| Tuesday | Moderate bullish | Second-best day. 55% winners in updated tests. Good for buying. |
| Wednesday | Weak/neutral | Slight negative bias in some periods. Proceed with caution for longs. |
| Thursday | Bearish | Worst day for buying. Selling pressure tends to spill into Friday. Avoid new long entries on Thursday. |
| Friday | Bullish close bias | 57% close above open with +$134 average. End-of-week rally tendency. |

### Bond Market TDW Biases

| Day | Bias | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Monday | Bullish | 55% positive open-to-close, +$53 average. |
| Tuesday | Strongest bullish | Best day to buy bonds. Largest open-to-close changes. |
| Wednesday | Moderate bullish | Reasonable for bond buys. |
| Thursday | Weak | Largest daily ranges but negative bias. |
| Friday | Strong bullish | Strong for bonds. High ranges and positive closes. |

### Application to Stock Trading

- **Filter all short-term entries by TDW**: Favor Monday/Tuesday/Friday for stock buys. Avoid Thursday for new long positions.
- **Combine TDW with expansion**: Buy on bias day at open + X% of prior day's range. For S&P Monday buys: open + 0.05% of Friday's range yielded $95,150 profits over 758 trades at 57% accuracy.
- **TDW as setup condition**: Use favorable TDW as one layer in a multi-factor entry decision.

## Trading Day of the Month (TDM)

### Core Discovery

Specific trading days within each month exhibit persistent rally or decline tendencies. TDM counts the actual trading day number (not calendar date), eliminating weekend/holiday ambiguity.

### Stock Market (S&P 500) TDM Patterns

**Best TDMs for buying (strongest rallies)**:
- **TDM 1-4**: First-of-month strength. Four consecutive profitable days at month start.
- **TDM 8**: Consistent mid-early-month rally point.
- **TDM 18-22**: End-of-month strength cluster. TDM 21 posts highest profit and largest average trade.

**TDMs to avoid or sell**:
- **TDM 5-7**: Consistent weakness zone. Notable declines.
- **TDM 12-13**: Mid-month weakness. Decline period in stocks.

### Bond Market TDM Patterns

**Best buying TDMs**:
- **TDM 10-13, 16**: Strong midmonth rally cluster.
- **TDM 18-22**: End-of-month rally. TDM 20 is the single best day.

**Best selling TDMs**:
- **TDM 12**: Midmonth dip. 76% profitable when selling. Filter with Gold uptrend (Gold close > 10 days ago) to boost average profit per trade from $133 to $359.

### Monthly Road Maps

Each month has a characteristic daily price pattern. These road maps (composite of historical TDM movements) provide general guidelines for expected price behavior. Use as context, not as rigid prediction.

### Application to Stock Trading

- **Month-end/first-of-month rally**: Buy on TDM 18-22 or first day of new month. This pattern is driven by mutual fund rebalancing and Bond market dynamics. For S&P 500: buying first trading day of each month (excluding January and March) with $3,500 stop yielded 80% accuracy across 270 trades.
- **Midmonth dip**: Expect weakness around TDM 5-7 and 12-13. Use for short entries or to avoid new longs.
- **TDM as setup filter**: Only take short-term buy/sell signals when the TDM environment is favorable.

## Chart Patterns for Short-Term Trading

### Pattern Philosophy

The best patterns represent emotional extremes where the public is lured into the wrong side. Immediate reversal of such extremes generates powerful short-term moves. All patterns work best when confirmed by TDW, TDM, inter-market relationships, and trend conditions.

### Outside Day with Down Close (Bullish)

**Setup**: Day's high > prior day's high AND day's low < prior day's low AND close < prior day's low.

**Entry**: Buy on next day's open if it opens lower than the outside day's close.

**Conditions**: Take on any day except Thursday. Use $2,000 stop and first profitable opening exit.

**Performance (S&P 500)**: 85-86% accuracy, $477-555 average profit per trade, profit factor 2.62-3.07.

**Rationale**: Looks terribly bearish to the public, but the extreme range and immediate failure the next day signals capitulation. Buying after the lower open captures the reversal.

**Stock Application**: Monitor for outside days with down closes on SPY, QQQ, or individual stocks. If next session opens lower, enter long. Works on all time frames including 5-min, 15-min, 30-min, and hourly charts.

### Smash Day Reversals (Type 1 - Naked)

**Buy Setup**: A day closes below the prior day's low (naked down close). The very next day, price rallies above the smash day's high.

**Sell Setup**: A day closes above the prior day's high (naked up close). The very next day, price falls below the smash day's low.

**Entry**: Enter on the penetration of the smash day's high (for buys) or low (for sells).

**Rationale**: The public bought the breakout or sold the breakdown. Immediate reversal the next day traps them. Their forced exit adds momentum to our trade direction.

**Usage Contexts**:
1. **In strong trends**: Use smash days as re-entry points. A smash down day in an uptrend, immediately reversed, confirms the trend is intact.
2. **In trading ranges**: A smash day that immediately reverses suggests a false breakout and probable range exit in the opposite direction.

### Smash Day Reversals (Type 2 - Hidden)

**Buy Setup**: An up-close day where the close is in the lower 25% of the day's range and below the day's open. Next day, price rallies above the hidden smash day's high.

**Sell Setup**: A down-close day where the close is in the upper 25% of the day's range and above the day's open. Next day, price falls below the hidden smash day's low.

**Rationale**: The market appeared to close in one direction (up/down) but actually closed weak/strong within its range. The hidden nature of the reversal traps more participants.

### Specialists' Trap (False Breakout)

**Sell Trap Setup**:
1. Up-trending market moves sideways in congestion for 5-10 days
2. Price breaks out to the upside with a naked close above the entire trading range
3. Within 1-3 days, price falls below the true low of the breakout day

**Buy Trap Setup**:
1. Down-trending market stabilizes sideways for 5-10 days
2. Price breaks out to the downside with a naked close below all daily lows
3. Within 1-3 days, price rallies above the true high of the breakdown day

**Rationale**: The breakout triggered all stop orders and lured breakout traders. When price immediately reverses, these trapped traders must exit, adding fuel to the reversal.

**Stock Application**: Watch for stocks breaking out of consolidation ranges. If the breakout fails and price reverses through the breakout day's opposite extreme within 1-3 days, enter in the reversal direction. This is the Wyckoff "spring" and "upthrust" concept applied to short-term stock trading.

### Oops! Pattern (Gap Reversal)

**Buy Signal**: Market opens below the prior day's low. Price then rallies back to the prior day's low. Buy on a stop at that level.

**Sell Signal**: Market opens above the prior day's high. Price then falls back to the prior day's high. Sell on a stop at that level.

**Performance (S&P 500 buys, any day except Wed/Thu)**: 82% accuracy, $435 average profit per trade.

**Important Note (2011 Update)**: This pattern was diminished by the shift from pit trading to electronic markets. The gap openings that drove this pattern are less frequent due to near-continuous electronic trading. However, the principle remains valid when genuine gap opens occur — for example, on Monday opens after weekend news, or after earnings announcements in individual stocks.

**Stock Application**: After earnings-driven gaps below prior day's low in individual stocks, if price recovers to the prior low, the Oops! principle applies. Use on stocks that gap down on news but show immediate recovery strength. Similarly applies to pre-market gap opens in index ETFs.

## Volatility Breakout: Greatest Swing Value (GSV)

### Core Concept

GSV measures the "failure swing" — the distance price moved from the open in one direction on days that ultimately closed in the opposite direction. Exceeding this average failure swing signals genuine momentum in the breakout direction.

### Calculation

**Buy Swing Value**: Average of (Open - Low) for the past N days that closed above their open (up-close days). These represent how far price could decline on bullish days without triggering a down close.

**Sell Swing Value**: Average of (High - Open) for the past N days that closed below their open (down-close days). These represent how far price could rally on bearish days without triggering an up close.

### Entry Rules

**Buy**: When price rises above the open by more than 180% of the average buy swing value, in conjunction with a valid setup.

**Sell**: When price falls below the open by more than 180% of the average sell swing value, in conjunction with a valid setup.

**Stop**: 225% of the average swing value from the opening price.

### Key Parameters

- **Lookback period**: 1-4 days produces the best results (not 10+ days as intuition might suggest).
- **Multiplier**: 180% of average swing value for entry, 225% for stop.
- **Setup requirements**: Never trade GSV alone. Require an oversold/overbought condition, TDW filter, and/or inter-market confirmation.

### S&P 500 GSV Setup Example

- **Buy setup**: Close < close 6 days ago (oversold) AND favorable TDW (Monday, Tuesday, or Wednesday) AND Bonds close > 15 days ago
- **Entry**: Buy at open + 180% of 4-day average buy swing value
- **Stop**: $2,500 flat dollar stop
- **Exit**: First profitable opening (bailout exit)
- **Performance**: $105,675 profits, 67% accuracy, $427 average per trade

### Bond Market GSV Setup Example

- **Buy setup**: Close < close 5 days ago (oversold) AND TDW is Tuesday, Wednesday, or Friday
- **Entry**: Buy at open + 180% of 4-day average buy swing value
- **Stop**: $1,600
- **Exit**: First profitable opening after 2 days in trade
- **Performance**: $52,812, 75% accuracy, $328 average per trade

### Practical Stock Application

- **Individual stocks**: Calculate GSV using recent 4-day failure swings. When a stock exceeds 180% of its average failure swing from the open, it signals genuine momentum. Use as confirmation for breakout entries.
- **Monday buy after Friday down close**: If S&P/stock closes down on Friday, buy Monday at open + Friday's (high - open) swing value, backed by Bonds closing > 15 days ago. The most successful interday mechanical technique Williams identifies.

### GSV Limitations (Electronic Markets)

Electronic markets have reduced the effectiveness of GSV as a standalone entry tool because the gap between sessions is much smaller. TDW biases still hold. The underlying concept — that exceeding the average range of failed moves signals genuine momentum — remains sound and can be adapted.

## Inter-Market Analysis: Willspread

### Core Concept

Markets move because of real fundamental relationships, not technical indicators alone. Willspread measures the relative flow of price between a primary and secondary market to detect when fundamental conditions support a trade direction.

### Calculation

1. Divide primary market price by secondary market price, multiply by 100
2. Calculate a 5-period exponential moving average of this spread
3. Calculate a 20-period exponential moving average of this spread
4. Willspread = 5-period EMA - 20-period EMA

### Key Market Relationships

| Primary Market | Secondary Market | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|
| Bonds | Gold | When Bonds strengthen vs Gold (Willspread positive), Bonds should rally. Gold in downtrend is bullish for Bonds. |
| S&P 500 | T-Bonds/T-Bills | When stocks strengthen vs interest rates (Willspread positive), stocks should rally. Interest rate declines (rising Bond prices) support stocks. |

### Trading Rules

**Buy Signal**: Willspread crosses from negative to positive territory. Confirm by waiting for the next bar to rally above the high of the crossover bar.

**Sell Signal**: Willspread crosses from positive to negative territory. Confirm by waiting for the next bar to fall below the low of the crossover bar.

**Time Frames**: Works on daily, 30-minute, and 15-minute charts. For intraday: use 5-period / 20-period EMAs. For daily: use 14-period / 19-period EMAs.

### Willspread + First-of-Month Strategy

Combine Willspread buy signals with the first-of-month rally tendency. Take Willspread buys only during the month-end/month-start window (TDM 18 through TDM 5 of new month). In 1997 testing: 13 total trades, 10 winners, net 99.70 S&P points ($24,925).

**Best months for this combination**: February, March, May, July, September, October, November.

### Application to Stock Trading

- **Bond/stock relationship**: When Bond prices are rising (yields falling), stocks are supported. Construct a Willspread between S&P 500 (or individual stock) and Bond prices. Positive crossings signal favorable fundamental backdrop.
- **Sector rotation**: Willspread can be applied between sector ETFs and broader indices to detect relative strength shifts.
- **Quality filter**: Even when chart patterns look bullish, if Willspread is negative, the fundamental backdrop doesn't support the trade. Pass.

## Three-Bar High/Low Channel System

### Setup

Calculate a 3-bar moving average of the highs and a 3-bar moving average of the lows on 5-minute, 15-minute, or 30-minute charts.

### Trading Rules

1. **Determine trend direction** using swing point reversal system (short-term highs and lows)
2. **In uptrend**: Buy at the 3-bar moving average of the lows. Take profits at the 3-bar moving average of the highs. Repeat.
3. **In downtrend**: Sell short at the 3-bar moving average of the highs. Cover at the 3-bar moving average of the lows. Repeat.
4. **Never buy the low in a downtrend or sell the high in an uptrend**.

### Swing Point Trend Identification

- **Uptrend changes to downtrend**: When price falls below the most recent short-term low
- **Downtrend changes to uptrend**: When price rises above the most recent short-term high
- **Pattern A** (stronger signal): The low/high violated is the one that preceded a new swing extreme
- **Pattern B** (weaker signal): Price makes a lower high/higher low then breaks the intermediate swing point

### Combined with Willspread

Use Willspread to determine the fundamental trend direction, then use the 3-bar channel for tactical entries. If Willspread is positive, only buy the 3-bar lows; if negative, only sell the 3-bar highs. This combines fundamental direction with technical entry precision.

## Seasonal & Monthly Strategies

### Month-End / First-of-Month Rally

**The single most persistent seasonal pattern identified.**

**S&P 500 Strategy**:
- Buy on the first trading day of each month (skip January and March)
- Stop: $3,500 (full-size) or $1,600 (E-Mini)
- Exit: First profitable opening
- Performance: 80% accuracy over 270 trades, $546 average profit per trade
- Enhancement: Only take trade if Bonds closed higher the day prior to entry than two days earlier

**Bond Strategy**:
- Buy on TDM 18 (fifth trading day before month-end) through first few days of new month
- Stop: $1,100-1,500
- Exit: First profitable opening or close 3 days after entry
- Filter: Gold close < 24 days ago (Gold in downtrend) dramatically improves results
- Performance (with Gold filter): 75-89% accuracy, $356-719 average profit per trade

### End-of-Month Bond Entry (TDM 18)

- Buy on open of TDM 18 with $1,500 stop, exit close 3 days after entry
- 71% accuracy, $250 avg profit, $34,875 net over 139 trades (1986-1998)
- **With Gold filter** (Gold < 24 days ago): 75% accuracy, $356 avg profit, drawdown halved

### Late-Month Bond Entry (TDM 22)

- Buy on open of TDM 22 with $1,500 stop, exit close 3 days after entry
- 76% accuracy, $496 avg profit
- **With Gold filter**: 89% accuracy, $719 avg profit, drawdown just $1,500, 17 consecutive winners

### Midmonth Bond Sell (TDM 12)

- Sell on open of TDM 12 with $1,400 stop, exit 3 days after entry
- 76% accuracy, $133 avg profit
- **With Gold uptrend filter** (Gold > 10 days ago): 78% accuracy, $359 avg profit, drawdown halved

### Target Months to Avoid

**S&P 500**: January and March show weakest first-of-month results. Skip these months.

**Bonds**: January, February, April, and October show weakest first-of-month results.

### Application to Stock Trading

- **Monthly rhythm**: Expect stock strength in the last 3-5 trading days of each month through the first 4 trading days of the new month. Position accordingly.
- **Midmonth caution**: Reduce long exposure around TDM 5-7 and TDM 12-13.
- **Bond confirmation**: Before taking month-end stock buys, confirm Bonds are trending higher. Bonds lead stocks.
- **Seasonal overlay**: Overlay TDM patterns onto individual stock analysis. A stock breakout attempt during TDM 5-7 (weak period) deserves more skepticism than one occurring at TDM 18-22 (strong period).

## Exit Rules

### The Three Exit Rules

**Rule 1: Always Use a Dollar Stop**

Every trade must have a maximum dollar loss defined before entry. This is the safety net when all else fails. Typical stops: $1,500-2,500 for futures (scale appropriately for stock position size). The stop should never be removed.

**Rule 2: Bailout Exit (First Profitable Opening)**

Exit on the first profitable opening after entry. Even if the profit is only one tick, take it.

- **For fast markets (S&P 500, stocks)**: Exit on the first profitable opening
- **For slower markets**: Delay the bailout 1-2 days to allow the trade to develop, increasing average profit per trade
- **E-Mini/stock adaptation**: Given electronic market structure, the bailout may be adapted to first profitable session or first profitable close

**Rule 3: Exit and Reverse on Opposite Signal**

If holding a position and an opposite signal appears from the same system, do not wait for the stop or bailout. Go with the most current signal immediately. The latest signal carries the most information.

### Additional Exit Considerations

**Time-Based Exit**: If no profit materializes within X days, the condition you were trading for has likely evaporated. Exit. For a 4-day trading time frame, if no profit by day 4, exit at the close.

**Dual Time Frame Exit**: Use one time frame for entry and a longer time frame for exit. If entering on a 4-day oversold condition, use an 8-day overbought reading to signal exit. This prevents exiting too early while still capturing the swing.

**Overbought Exit Caution**: When the market is overbought and you're long, the temptation is to take profit — but you may be exiting the trend too soon. Using a longer overbought time frame for exit allows you to stay in the trade longer.

### Application to Stock Trading

- **Stop-loss**: Define maximum risk as a percentage of position size (e.g., 2-5% of portfolio value per trade) before every entry
- **First profitable open**: After a swing trade entry, exit at the first open where the position shows a profit. This enforces discipline and prevents giving back gains
- **Signal reversal**: If your system generates a sell while you're long, act immediately. Don't hold and hope
- **Time stop**: If a 2-4 day swing trade shows no profit by day 4, exit. The catalyst has passed
- **Never use Fibonacci**: Williams found Fibonacci numbers are not optimal for exits

## Day Trading Specific Rules

### Temperament Requirements

Day trading requires: (1) intensity and focused concentration every minute, (2) ability to make instant decisions, (3) capacity to immediately reverse a decision without hesitation. If any of these is lacking, day trading will result in losses.

### The Mathematical Reality

Day traders must have large positions to capture small moves — the inverse of optimal trading. One large loss can wipe out many small profits. The 80% win rate means nothing if the 20% losses are disproportionately large.

### Preferred Approach: 2-4 Day Swings

The optimal short-term time frame allows enough time for trend to develop while still being short-term. Daily bar charts set up patterns that spur moves of 2-4 days. This is the Williams preferred style — not pure day trading.

### If Day Trading

- **Catch the current trend**, nothing else. Do not forecast. Mirror the market.
- **Trend identification**: Use swing point reversals on intraday charts (5-min, 15-min, 30-min)
- **Entry**: Use 3-bar high/low channel to buy pullbacks in uptrend, sell rallies in downtrend
- **Confirmation**: Use Willspread to confirm the fundamental trend before taking intraday trades
- **TDW filter**: Only take day trades aligned with the daily TDW bias

## Pattern Integration Framework

### Multi-Factor Entry Checklist

For the highest probability trades, combine as many of the following factors as possible:

1. **TDW**: Is today a favorable day of the week for the trade direction?
2. **TDM**: Is this a favorable trading day of the month?
3. **Seasonal month**: Is this month historically favorable for the trade direction?
4. **Overbought/Oversold**: Is the market extended in the opposite direction (mean reversion setup)?
5. **Chart pattern**: Is a recognized pattern present (outside day, smash day, specialists' trap, Oops!)?
6. **GSV breakout**: Has price exceeded the failure swing threshold from the opening?
7. **Inter-market confirmation**: Is Willspread supportive? Are Bonds trending favorably?
8. **Trend alignment**: Is the short-term trend (swing points) aligned with the trade?

### Entry Priority

Take trades only when multiple factors align. A minimum of 2-3 confirmations should be present. The more factors that stack, the larger the position size should be.

### Stock Market Application Summary

| Pattern | Stock Application | Best Time Frame |
|---|---|---|
| TDW Bias | Favor Monday/Tuesday/Friday for stock buys | Daily |
| TDM Rally | Buy TDM 18-22 through TDM 4 of new month | Daily |
| Outside Day | Buy next open if lower than outside day close (except Thursday) | Daily / Intraday |
| Smash Day | Enter on reversal of prior day's extreme | Daily |
| Specialists' Trap | Fade failed breakouts from 5-10 day ranges | Daily |
| Oops! (adapted) | Buy stocks that gap below prior low and recover to it | Daily (earnings gaps) |
| GSV Breakout | Confirm genuine momentum when swing exceeds failure average | Intraday / Daily |
| Willspread | Use Bond-stock spread to confirm fundamental backdrop | 30-min / Daily |
| 3-Bar Channel | Buy pullbacks in uptrend, sell rallies in downtrend | 5-min to 60-min |
| Month-end Rally | Buy SPY/QQQ on first day of month (skip Jan, Mar) | Daily |
